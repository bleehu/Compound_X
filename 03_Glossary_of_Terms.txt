Glossary of Terms
==============================
    Here is a list of some proper nouns and terms that are different in Compound 
X than in the English Language normally. If one is missing, please create an 
issue in Github asking for it! Hope it helps!

Action: 
    In Compound X, an Action rarely means a single abstract bodily movement as 
it does in English. Instead, an Action is a measure of time specifically during 
a Player's turn in Combat. See "Actions" Section in the "Combat" Chapter in 
Basic Rules.txt.

Armor Piercing Level:
    Different sets of Armor stop different amounts of firepower depending on
what armor plates where put in it. Armor Piercing Level (abbreviated APL) is a
measure either of how much armor a weapon can pierce without losing damage to
the armor, or what level of weapon penetration an armor will completely stop. 
See the "Other Combat Details" section of Basic Rules for more information.
