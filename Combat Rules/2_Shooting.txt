Ranged Combat
==============================

    Most of the combat in Compound X are gun battles. Some characters are brave
or foolish enough to bring a knife or a sword to a gun battle. For the rest of
us, these rules should explain how to shoot things and what happens when you are
shot.

===== Shooting =====

== Rolling a Ranged Attack ==

    To hit a target, Players must roll a d10 that is over their weapon's miss 
stat. When an enemy is in cover, their cover score is added to your weapon's 
miss chance. Lets say your normal ranged miss chance is 2, and the enemy is in 
full cover, your miss chance is increased by 4, for a final DC of 6. So a roll 
of 7-10 would be successful.

===== Miss Chance Limits =====

    At any time when using a melee or ranged weapon, you have a minimum of -2 
weapon miss chance, and a minimum of +1 miss chance modifier from automatic or 
burst fire modes (if relevant). These minimums apply after all Stat/Attachment 
modifiers, at all ranges, and before cover and any other environmental effects. 
An ability can only exceed these limits if it specifically says that it does so.

    Outside a weapon's longest range, you cannot hit your target.
Also, weapons cannot shoot over 100m without magnifying sights, or over 150m 
without 2x+ magnification.

    To fire, you must be within the longest range limit of your gun*, i.e. be at 
a distance smaller than your gun's largest Range Bracket**, and you must not be 
out of ammo. You can aim and fire or, more simply, just fire at a target. If you 
shoot without aiming, you are "Hip Firing" and incur additional aiming penalties 
(see Hip Firing, below). 

*Actually you can fire at any range you like, but you won't necessarily hit anything.
Except for air, you will always hit air (unless you're in space).

**You cannot shoot weapons at a distance of over 100m without magnifying sights 
or over 150m without 2x+ magnification.

    Aiming at an enemy requires one action but significantly increases the 
effectiveness of your fire. Taking aim requires that you select a particular target 
that you can either perceive directly or have a high confidence in its current 
position. You must be able to see or otherwise percieve the target clearly, but they 
do not have to be within your weapon's range. Against this target only, ranged attacks 
follow the normal, non-Hip Fire rules. Characters may cease aiming as a free action, 
for example to aim at a different target. Additionally, aim is ceased automatically 
in any of the following circumstances: 

* The target dies***.
* The target moves a large distance unexpectedly****.
* The aiming character hunkers.
* The aiming character is thrown (for example, by a frag grenade).
* The aiming character suffers impairment to his or her primary sense (such as from a flashbang).

***As an optional rule, if a character's aim target dies, and the death was not 
unexpected, then the character may shift aim to another target within 5m of the first 
as a Free Action. DM discretion is advised for close combat situations.

****Possibly by coming out of cover 5+ meters from the last known location.

    Aiming is relatively simple and does not need to be treated with excessive
formality. If a character could reasonably take or keep aim at something, then he or 
she can.

== Fire Rates ==

    Most weapons are Semi-Auto, meaning that each time you pull the trigger, the 
gun fires once and chambers a new round automatically. It takes 1 Action to fire 
a semi-auto weapon in this way. Some guns, such as Shotguns and Bolt-Action 
sniper rifles require 2 Actions to fire the gun, where the first Action is a 
trigger pull, and the second Action is the rechambering of the weapon. Some weapons
are capable of higher rates of fire, like Assault Rifles. These weapons often have
more than one fire mode such as Fully-Automatic (Auto) and Burst. Auto or Burst 
mode allows the user to fire 6 or 3 shots for 1 Action, respectively (unless
otherwise noted). 

== Automatic Firing ==

    When rolling for automatic fire, players must roll one d10 for each bullet 
fired unless otherwise noted. All dice are rolled at the same time, to keep the game
moving quickly. The dice are read from left to right, and the player cannot switch
the order that the dice fell in. For any roll that has the potential to be a jam, 
roll the second d10 for it before rolling the next automatic-fire d10. If the roll 
causes a jam, the rest of the automatic-fire d10s are not used. 

== Gun Jams ==
    If at any time that you are firing a gun and you roll 1 on an accuracy roll,
roll a second d10. If that second d10 roll is equal to or less than the weapon's Jam 
Range, the weapon jams, necessitating a Weapon - [X] Skill check, DC 60 that takes 
one Action before the weapon can be fired again.

== Hip Firing ==

    Add 3 to a weapon's miss chance. You cannot use optical attachments in hip 
firing unless otherwise noted. It is much smarter to takes one action to Aim, 
and spend the rest of your shots firing. It's also a great idea to take an 
action at the end of your turn to "hunker," and gain a +2 cover advantage.

    If your weapon has a minimum distance (usually because of a high-powered
scope), and you fire inside that distance, you are forced to hip fire.

== Blind Firing ==

    Add 6 to a ranged weapon's miss chances. Blind firing allows you to shoot 
around cover without looking or putting yourself at risk. You can blind fire 
while hunkered. Your blind fire miss chance is affected by your base weapon miss 
chance(s), not affected by attachments unless otherwise noted, reduced by PER 
stat combat bonus (as usual), and reduced by LUCK combat stat bonus. It's 
recommended to calculate this separate miss chance and write it down before 
combat.

== Firing into Melee Combat ==

    When firing at a character engaged in Melee Combat, you aren't guaranteed 
to hit the target you intended. Before rolling accuracy, roll a DC 50 Luck check. 
You may add 10 to your roll if you are aimed at your target. On success, you hit 
your intended target. On failure, you hit a randomly chosen character engaged in 
Melee Combat with your intended target. In either case your attack then proceeds 
as normal. This Luck check cannot Critically succeed or fail.

===== Suppression ===== 

    Every player with a ranged weapon gets the option to Suppress as the last 
action of their turn. Suppression, also known as, "laying down fire", 
"covering fire", or "suppressive fire" is the art of shooting a hail of 
bullets (as accurately as possible) to try and prevent the enemy from 
effectively fighting back while your team maneuvers. Suppression comes in
three flavors: light, medium, and heavy; these indicate how wide of an area
is suppressed as well as how effective that suppression is (defined below).
The type of suppression available to you is dependent on your weapon.

    When you Suppress, you aim at the target as part of the action and fire a
hail of bullets (within your weapon range). Suppression doesn't require any
rolls to initiate, the suppressor simply fires, creating a light/medium/heavy
suppression AOE (Area-of-Effect, typically a 1-3m circle). Even though Suppression
is an AOE effect, if you cross in-front of someone (someone who is suppressing 
a different person) you will likely trigger automatic attack rolls, DM's discretion.

    If a suppressed target moves out into the open (see below), they 
trigger automatic attack rolls (or automatic hits) by the suppressor, once 
per target per suppressor's turn. If the suppressed target shoots, they 
fire with +1 miss chance, not-stackable. Suppression status can't be purged 
unless you move outside the AOE.Â The only other way to stop being suppressed 
is to stop the suppressor from using a suppression action on you at the end 
of their turn.

Moving out into the open: 
    In the context of suppression and movement, "moving out into the open" 
includes moving into a new location while you can be hit by shots from the 
suppressor (this excludes moving into complete concealment, such as going prone 
behind a high concrete wall). For example, the following situations would 
trigger a free hit by the suppressor and give you the 'suppressed' status while 
remaining in the area (let's assume you are upright (not crouched or prone)):
moving from partial cover to an adjacent partial cover, moving from complete 
concealment behind a barricade to partial cover, and moving when you are caught 
out in the open.

    If the suppressor cannot physically hit you (such as being completely behind 
an impenetrable barrier) you are not suppressed. The suppressor doesn't need to 
see you to hit you, as in the case of suppressing a cloaked target. 

== Light Suppression ==

    As the last action of your turn, aim at a target and fire 3 rounds (or the 
rest of your magazine, at least 1 round has to be fired) to suppress 1m radius 
AOE around the target. The target takes a +1 miss chance malus until the start 
of your next turn, and if the target moves out into the open**, then roll an 
immediate reaction to hit the target with a (non-automatic fire) accuracy roll. 
Immediate reactions are stackable on a per-weapon basis.

== Medium/Moderate Suppression ==

    Identical to light suppression with the following exceptions, you must fire 
6 rounds from the current magazine to achieve 'moderate', and you don't have to 
roll to hit -- you automatically hit with one attack. Medium suppression always 
hits armor if applicable.

== Heavy Suppression ==

    Identical to light suppression with the following exceptions: you must fire 
10 rounds from the current magazine to achieve 'heavy', you don't have to roll 
to hit -- you automatically hit with two attacks. Heavy suppression always hits 
armor. You also suppress all targets within a 2m radius AOE around the primary target.

**"Moving out into the open" includes moving into a new location while you can
be hit by shots from the suppressor (this excludes moving into complete concealment,
such as going prone behind a high concrete wall). For example, the following situations
would trigger a free hit by the suppressor and give you the 'suppressed' status
while remaining in the area (let's assume you are upright (not crouched or prone)):
moving from partial cover to an adjacent partial cover, moving from complete concealment
behind a barricade to partial cover, and moving when you are caught out in the open.

    If the suppressor cannot physically hit you (such as being completely behind an 
impenetrable barrier) you are not suppressed. The suppressor doesn't need to see 
you, to hit you.

===== Stealth Attacks With Guns =====

    Ranged weapon stealth-attacks (including explosive grenades but not any 
other thrown weapons) have -1 miss chance to hit if 'adequate' aiming time is 
given (DM's discretion: how rushed you are, or how skilled you are at stealth, 
etc). Ranged weapon stealth-attacks gain +20 bonus damage. 

===== Critical Hits =====

    When you perform an Accuracy Roll (while not firing a gun in burst or 
automatic mode), you may roll high enough to use your Critical Hit Chance. 
Critical Hit Chance is based on your Luck Stat, but can also be modified by 
abilities, weapons, attachments, etc. 

    If your Accuracy Roll is high enough, you activate your Critical Hit Chance.
When this happens, you roll a second d10 to determine if you have landed a Critical 
Hit, an Extra-Critical Hit, or, if you have less than average Luck, merely hit your enemy. 

    A Critical Hit deals +20 damage and an Extra-Critical Hit deals +30 damage. 

    Some abilities or feats have additional effects that trigger when you land
Critical or Extra-Critical Hits.
