==============================
Melee Combat
==============================

    A character of standard size occupies 1m of space. This is not the physical 
space occupied, but rather both the area effectively controlled by the character and 
the minimum necessary to effectively fight.

    Two characters engaged in melee combat are considered to be in adjacent 1m 
spaces, not in the same 1m space. Fights don't generally start face-to-face unless 
you're at a bar.

    Once a character has attempted to attack another at melee range (1m), 
they are both considered to be in melee combat. They can make attacks against 
each other with unarmed strikes, melee weapons (improvised or not), or CQB guns 
as normal. Attacking a target more than 1m away, using a non-CQB weapon, or 
moving away from the melee (under the character's own power: explosion knockback 
does not count) will incur an Opportunity Attack as described below.
    
===== Opportunity Attack =====

    A reactionary attack that is triggered when an opponent leaves melee combat, 
walks past (within melee range) an alert character, performing a skill check 
when engaged in melee combat that requires the use of the character's primary 
manipulator limbs (so a medicine check to stabilize an ally would incur an 
attack, but an acrobatics check to kick away a grenade would not) or by 
trying to shoot an opponent more than 1m away while engaged in melee combat.

    Opportunity attacks can be made with a drawn CQB weapon or a melee weapon. 
If the free attack is made with a CQB weapon and the weapon is not already 
aimed at the target, standard Hip Firing rules apply.

===== Making Melee Attacks =====

    Melee attackers make accuracy rolls with a d10, increased by strength and 
dexterity combat modifiers and their weapon's accuracy modifier. To successfully 
hit, the result must be greater than (not equal to) the opponent's Guard roll. 
If you successfully hit your opponent, armor applies as normal except as 
detailed in the next two topics.

    Defending players roll Guard with a d10 as well, increased by fortitude 
and dexterity combat modifiers and their weapon's guard bonus. Guard bonuses are 
not usually listed in individual weapon entries (some exceptions exist), but 
instead are based on weapon type. See the table below for weapon type Guard 
modifiers. A character must be proficient with a weapon to benefit from its 
Guard modifier, otherwise it is treated as an improvised melee weapon of the 
appropriate size. 

    A Guard roll equal to or greater than an attacker's accuracy causes 
the attack to miss. One may think of melee attacks as opposed contests of skill, 
though no Skill check applies to these attacks and blocks.

== Hitting What You Intend ==

    If you roll 3 or more above your target's Guard, you may ignore any 
armor worn by the target and damage health directly.
    
== Stealth Attacks in Melee Combat ==

    If you stealth-attack a target with a melee attack, your target has a Guard 
of 0. Recall that if you roll 3+ above the opponent's Guard, you ignore the 
opponent's armor and deal full damage. This signifies that the target gets hit 
in whatever you deem to be the most vulnerable; i.e., the head, neck, or the 
chest (over the heart, etc).

== Blunt Force ==

    Unless otherwise specified, melee weapons have an APL of 0, which 
for most weapons would mean they do no damage if they hit armor. Instead, 
melee attacks that hit armor still deal the STR mod portion of their damage 
directly to the target's health. For example, a One-handed combat sword that 
deals 20 + STR mod + DEX mod damage, wielded by a character with a STR mod 
of 12, that hits its target's armor would deal no damage to the armor and 
12 damage to the target's health. If the sword was a Hybrid weapon and the 
attack was a two-handed strike, the health damage would be 18.

== Nonlethal Damage ==

    By default, melee attacks deal lethal damage, like the vast majority of 
guns. This just means that when an attack drops a target to 0 health, they 
enter the Bleeding Out state. However, when fighting unarmed or with a melee 
weapon that you are proficient with, you may declare a melee attack you have 
not yet rolled to be nonlethal. This imposes a -2 accuracy penalty, since you are 
imposing constraints upon yourself on where you can strike, but if a nonlethal 
attack would reduce a target to 0 health, the target drops to 0 health and becomes
Unconscious instead of becoming Downed and beginning to Bleed Out. The Unconscious
condition ends when the character's health increases above 0. 

===== Melee Accuracy and Guard Critical Hits =====

    See "Critical Hits" below for general Critical information. Melee Critical 
hits deal extra damage as normal. Critical Guard rolls block all damage from any 
non-Extra-critical melee attack. Extra-critical Guard rolls block all damage from 
the incoming attack. 

    Melee Accuracy rolls may Critically fail in the same way as firearms. 
Unless otherwise specified, melee weapons have a Jam range of 2. Should your 
melee weapon "jam", it catches on something in the environment at the DM's 
discretion, if applicable, and is stuck. Unsticking the weapon requires a 
Weapons - Melee check, as a firearm would require the appropriate 
Weapons - [X] check. If you pass the DC by at least 30 you do not provoke an 
Opportunity Attack. If nothing is available for the weapon to get stuck in, 
it is instead dropped. You will always succeed in picking up a dropped weapon 
if it is within reach, and may still use the skill check to attempt to avoid 
an Opportunity Attack while doing so.

    When using a firearm as an improvised weapon, if you Critically fail an 
accuracy check and the weapon is loaded (and cocked, if a single-shot pistol or 
bolt-action rifle), then instead of becoming stuck or dropped the weapon 
accidentally discharges. Roll 1d10. On a 3-10, the shot travels in a random 
direction, striking the first valid target in its path within its range. The 
target may avoid taking damage by succeeding on a DC 110 Reflex Save. On a 1-2, 
the bullet strikes you, hitting armor if applicable. In either case, you must 
pass a DC 40 Reflex save to avoid dropping the firearm. This DC increases to 80 
if you took damage from the accidental discharge.

    Shooting yourself as a result of critical failure does not make use of 
the Shooting into a Melee rule, unless you are sharing the same square as 
another character, such as during a grapple.

    Guard rolls can never Critically fail. Rolling a 1 on a Guard check 
has no special meaning.

== Improvised Melee Weapons ==

    Sometimes you just need to smack somebody with whatever is 
available. When using an object not intended as a melee weapon to make a 
melee attack, use the stats from the improvised melee weapon of the most 
appropriate size: light, one-handed, or two-handed.

    Generally speaking, objects that fit in one hand, like pistols, beer 
mugs, improvised knuckles, and objects of similar size, are considered Light. 
SMGs, table legs, lengths of cable, most kitchenware, and the like would be 
One-handed. Heavier objects like every other class of firearm, chairs, or 2x4s 
are Two-handed.

    Improvised weapons may be thrown using the ranged miss chance provided 
in the improvised weapon stat block. Their damage when thrown is the same as 
when used for melee strikes.

== Combat Maneuvers ==

    In addition to smashing an opponent directly, there are other offensive 
actions that characters in melee combat may take. Also, some exotic weapons may 
allow these maneuvers to be performed even outside melee: individual weapon 
rules take precedence.

    Maneuvers make use of opposed skill checks. Both the actor and defender 
will roll a check, which does not have to be the same skill, and whoever rolls 
a higher total wins. Defenders win ties. 

== The Opposed Maneuver Check ==

    Most maneuvers make use of the same mildly complex skill opposition, 
called the opposed maneuver check. It does not refer to a "maneuver" skill, 
but is short for the following instructions. The attacking or acting character 
rolls Athletics (STR), and the defender rolls his or her choice of Athletics (STR)
or Acrobatics (DEX). Initiating a grapple, shove, trip, etc. is mostly a matter 
of brute strength, but such attempts may be opposed strength for strength or 
dodged by superior agility.

    Similarly to Guard rolls, critical successes always defeat rolls of 
a lesser critical status and resolve normally against rolls of the same 
critical status. At the DM's discretion, where applicable, melee accuracy 
critical failure rules may apply to maneuver checks.

Grappling:
    Grappling is a maneuver where a character physically grabs another, 
attempting to immobilize the target. To initiate a grapple, a character initiates 
an opposed maneuver check. If the target wins, the grapple fails and nothing happens. 
If the grappler wins, both characters gain the Grappled state, and the attacker 
starts with control. 

    Characters shooting at a target in the Grappled state may hit both or 
either. With wide-effect weapons like flamethrowers or buckshot, the attack may 
be made against either target but the damage is divided evenly among the grappled 
characters. Attacks with other weapons have a 50% + the shooter's LUCK mod to hit 
the intended target, and otherwise hit the other.
    
    While in the Grappled state, most ranged attacks at range R2 or R3 (based 
on the weapon used) against either character have a 50% chance to hit the other, 
though shooters may add their LUCK mod to the 50 to hit their chosen target. Wider 
effect weapons like flamethrowers and buckshot always evenly divide their damage 
among the grappled characters.

    While in the grappled state, the characters are limited in the actions 
they can take and can only target each other. The character with control of the 
grapple may make Unarmed Strikes, use other combat maneuvers, attempt to Pin, or 
disengage. The character without control may make Unarmed Strikes, attempt to 
disengage, or attempt to gain control. Each attempt takes one Action. While in a 
grapple, the character in control may make 3 Actions per round, the character
that is not in control may make 2. 

    While in the Pinned state, a character may only attempt to disengage, and 
success will return the character to the grappled state, without control, instead 
of releasing the character from the grapple. The character grappling with a Pinned 
target may attempt to restrain the target with a further opposed maneuver check and 
appropriate tool, such as zip cuffs. Success renders the target helpless (until 
they can break the bonds, which depends on the item used, see item descriptions). 
Pinned targets are also vulnerable to Knockout and Kill actions: both render the 
target Unconscious and reduce them to 0 health, but a successful Kill action 
also forces the target to make a death saving throw. Knockout and Kill require two 
consecutively won opposed maneuver checks, and targets add their Shock modifier to
their roll when defending against attempts to Kill. If a character restrains, knocks
out, or kills a grappled target, he or she is still engaged in the grapple and must
spend an Action to disengage.
    
    Grappling-specific actions are described below.
    
Pin:    The attacker and defender make an opposed maneuver check. If the attacker 
    wins, the defender gains the Pinned state.
Disengage: Characters in control of a grapple may disengage without rolling. 
    Otherwise both characters choose one of Athletics (STR) or Acrobatics (DEX)
    and roll an opposed check (choices may differ). If the disengager wins, 
    the grapple ends (and the active character has 3 Actions available this 
    round).
Gain Control: The involved characters make an opposed maneuver check as if the 
    acting character was initiating. If successful, that character gains 
    control of the grapple, affecting the actions available to both characters.

Shoving:
    This maneuver attempts to force the target to move in a particular direction. 
The attacker must declare the direction he or she is attempting to move the target, 
then they roll an opposed maneuver check. If the attacker wins, both characters move 
in the indicated direction a number of meters equal to half the attacker's Strength. 
Shoving a grappled target does not end the grapple. Shoved targets to not provoke 
opportunity attacks, but shoving attackers might.

Kicking:
    Or whatever appendage your species uses to launch things. Kicking is identical
to Shoving except that only the target is moved, and that the target moves 50% farther 
if kicked directly away from the attacker. If a grappled target is successfully kicked, 
the grapple ends. Kicked targets do not provoke opportunity attacks,

Trip:
    This maneuver attempts to force the target to the floor. If the attacker wins 
an opposed maneuver check, the target gains the prone state. Tripping a grappled 
target ends the grapple.

Disarm:
    This maneuver attempts to relieve the target of a carried item or weapon. 
The character initiating this maneuver declares a weapon or item the defending 
character is wielding. Both attacker and defender choose between Athletics (STR)
and Acrobatics (DEX) (choices may differ) and make an opposed check. Defenders have 
Disadvantage on the check if they do not have proficiency with the targeted item 
(for this purpose, improvised melee weapons are treated as regular melee weapons 
of the appropriate size). If the attacker wins, the defender is forced to drop the 
targeted object.

===== Melee Weapons & Unarmed Fighting =====

    These weapons/attacks use an 'Accuracy Modifier' instead of
a 'Miss Chance', which is added to your combat dex modifier and
and any relevant feat or skill bonuses to oppose your opponent's 
Guard Roll. Melee weapons do not pierce armor, unless otherwise 
stated.

== Melee Weapon Size ==

    Melee weapons come in one of four size categories. The first 
three are Light, One-handed, and Two-handed. Characters start 
with proficiency with some number of these based on their class. The 
fourth category is Exotic. Acquiring proficiency with Exotic weapons does 
not grant access to all Exotic weapons, but rather to a particular type, 
such as whips. Exotic proficiencies may rarely be granted by Backgrounds, 
and are more commonly acquired by feats.

    When a Two-handed weapon uses a character's STR mod in its damage 
calculation and the character's STR mod is positive, that character instead 
uses 150% of their STR modifier to calculate damage. For example, if some 
two-handed weapon dealt damage equal to 40 + 2xSTR nod and the character 
wielding it had a STR mod of -4, each strike would deal 32 = 40 + (-4 * 2) 
damage. A character with the same weapon and a STR mod of 12 would deal 
76 = 40 + ((12 * 1.5) * 2) = 40 + (18 * 2) damage per strike.

    Some One-handed weapons have the Hybrid size property. Characters 
with proficiency with Two-handed melee weapons may make two-handed strikes 
with these weapons, which allows them to add their STR modifier as if 
the weapon was Two-handed (see the preceeding paragraph). Such a strike 
must be declared to be two-handed before rolling to hit, and the character 
doing so loses the benefits of any items that require his or her off hand to 
function.*

    Unarmed Strike is not a weapon and therefore does not have a 
size category. All characters are considered proficient with Unarmed 
Strike. Efficacy is an entirely separate issue.

*As an example, a character with a STR mod of 8 is attacking an enemy with a 
hammer of size One-handed - Hybrid that deals 40 + STR mod damage. Before 
rolling the attack, the player may declare that the character is making a 
two-handed strike, which will increase the damage from 40 + 8 = 48 to 
40 + (8 * 1.5) = 40 + 12 = 52. If that character was holding a weapon or 
defensive implement in his or her off-hand, that item cannot be used and 
it provides no bonuses for one round.

== Flanking ==
    If you are behind a target, aka flanking, your melee Accuracy rolls gain a +2 
bonus. Ranged attacks don't gain a specific bonus from flanking.
