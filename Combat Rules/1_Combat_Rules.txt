==============================
Combat
==============================

	Combat starts when either you or an enemy decides they would like to make an 
attack (or as the GM decrees). During combat, the flow of the game changes so 
that both player characters and the Non-Player Characters that are run by the
Game Master each take a turn in a specific order. 

	Combat can end many different ways. Obviously, if all characters on one side
or the other are dead, then combat ends. But Combat can also end with one side
retreating and escaping, or if one side surrenders. Not all combat is to the
death. Once Combat ends, the flow of play returns to the each character doing
as they like as described in the Basic Rules Section.

===== Starting a Fight =====

== Initiative ==

	When combat starts, all involved characters roll Initiative to determine the 
order in which they take turns. Initiative is a d100 roll that is modified only 
by Soldier class passive abilities, and higher numbers take their turn in combat 
first.

== Stealth Before Combat ==

	Some characters are very sneaky, and often wish to ambush or sneak past 
enemies. Stealth encounters can often straddle the line between combat and 
non-combat. When the encounter is time-sensitive, or if the movement of the 
sneaker is relative to the movment of what else is happening, then stealth can
require the same turn-based flow as combat. When the sneaking is happening under
less pressure, it can often skip the rigor of turn-based gameplay.

== Starting Combat From Hiding ==

	If a character succeeds on their stealth skill checks, gets the drop on
another character, and decides to attack, then the character or characters that 
were hidden get to take a whole round without the surprised characters getting
a turn. This is called the Surprise Round.

==============================
Rounds, Turns and Actions
==============================

    During Combat, each character gets one Turn per Round. You get 4 Actions on
your turn to do whatever you'd like to do.

===== Free Actions =====

	Free Actions refer to tasks that take miniscule amounts of time, even
in pitched combat, like looking around, speaking briefly, or reflexively 
shutting your eyes after being treated to a flash-bang. Aside from your 
GM's patience and willingness to believe your character can do everything you 
want in a negligible timescale, there is no limit to the number of Free Actions 
a character may take, and they may be used at any time.

===== Reactions =====

	Certain abilities or circumstances will allow you do something 
in response to a triggering event. Doing so requires using a special kind 
of Action called a Reaction. Reactions occur at the immediate moment 
that they are triggered, regardless of whose turn it is. Common uses of 
Reactions include Opportunity Attacks (described in "Melee Combat", above) 
and Held Actions, below. After the Reaction occurs, play continues as normal. 
If it was an opponent's turn, they continue their turn. 

	A character may use up to three Reactions per round, regardless of how 
many viable trigger circumstances occur.

===== Held Actions =====

	A type of Reaction. A player may choose to forgo using up to 2 Actions at 
the end of their turn. The player must declare to their DM what those actions 
are to be triggered by, and then play continues as normal. If the trigger occurs 
before the player's next turn, the player gets to immediately use their 1 or 2 
actions. If the trigger does not occur before the player's turn, they lose their
held action(s) and start their turn as normal. 

	For example, let's say my Character and his/her friends are walking along a 
ledge. I know that one of the Characters in the party is clumsy so I have my 
Character move along the ledge, and I ask the DM if I can save my last action to 
try and catch the clumsy Character, should they trip. The DM approves my plan 
and play continues. On the clumsy Character's turn, they start to scoot across
the ledge and trip! As soon as they trip, my held action triggers and my 
Character saves them from falling off the ledge and their turn continues. If 
they had not tripped, my held action would've been lost at the start of my 
following turn.

===== Saving Against Ongoing Conditions =====

	Attempting a save to end an ongoing condition takes one Action, 
unless the ability that applied the condition says otherwise. A character 
may only attempt to recover from a particular condition once per round.

===== Example Actions =====

	Below is a quick list of examples of things a character might want to do and 
how many Actions that would take out of their turn. Your character isn't limited 
to only these options; you can try to do almost anything you can think of, as 
long as what you're trying to do isn't an ability that needs to be unlocked 
elsewhere. If you'd like to do something that isn't on this list, your Game 
Master will decide how many Actions it will take.

Shooting: 1 Action
Aiming: 1 Action
Drawing a weapon: 1 Action
Reloading: listed in weapon stats
Suppressing an Area/Target: 1 Action
Changing fire mode: Free Action

Moving your Move Speed: 2 Actions
Hunkering Down in cover: 1 Action
Laying down: 1 Action
Standing up from laying down: 1 Action
Crouching: Free Action
Standing up from crouching: 1 Action

Talking: Free Action
Performing a Skill Check (other than Getting Bearings): 1 Action
Awareness checks to look for enemies: Free Action

==============================
Movement in Combat
==============================

===== Movement and Sprinting =====

	You can run 'Movement Speed' minus 'Movement Speed Penalty' number of meters 
for every 2 actions spent (Movement Speed Penalties should be rounded up before 
the subtraction). A character with 1 Movement Speed and 0 move speed penalties 
can move 1m per 2 actions, or 2m per 4 actions (a full turn). You can sprint 
instead of running, for a +1 movement bonus per action. However, firing your 
weapon after doing so will cause you to incur a +1 miss chance penalty. The 
penalty occurs during the actions you sprint, as well as 2 actions afterwards. 
You can sprint for a number of consecutive Actions equal to your Fortitude. You 
can jump horizontally DEX/2 meters, and add 1m if you have a 3m running start.
You can jump vertically STR/3 meters.

===== Using Cover/Stances =====

	Chances are, if an enemy can see you, they can shoot you. Using cover will 
make you harder to be hit. You will encounter many types of cover while 
adventuring throughout the galaxy. Many small objects provide only partial 
cover, either by partially obscuring your silhouette, or by providing slight 
protection from projectiles. Full cover will do both to a better degree.

	Partial Cover typically covers 30-50% of your body. Full Cover on the other 
hand will cover closer to 60-80%. Crouching or going prone will also take better 
advantage of your surroundings and make you a smaller target. The penalties for
an enemy shooting at you in different kinds of cover are listed below.

No Cover: +0
Partial Cover: +2 
Full Cover: +4
Crouching: +1 (on top of whatever cover you're behind, may completely obscure vision)
Prone: +2* 
Hunkering: +2 (on top of whatever cover you're behind.)

*(on top of whatever -partial- cover you're behind, otherwise, may completely 
obscure vision. Does not provide a bonus against an opponent that is within 5m 
of you if you aren't in cover from their perspective.)

Crouching:
	Crouching is a free action, and standing up costs 1 Action. While you are
crouched, you have -1 movement speed per action (minimum 1) and you cannot
sprint or use other movement abilities.

Prone:
	Going prone costs 1 Action, and standing up costs 1 Action. Lying flat down on
your chest makes you a smaller target and helps you aim better, but also makes you
easier to hit in melee. You gain +1 Accuracy with firearms while prone but suffer -2 to 
Guard checks. Being prone severely limits your movement: 1/2 movement speed while prone, 
round-up; maximum 2 movement per action.

Hunkering:
	Hunkering costs 1 action, and you cannot fire your weapons except by blind-fire 
(see Blind Firing, above). Imagine curling up in a ball, to pose the absolute smallest
target possible. Its a free action to un-hunker.

==============================
Being Shot At
==============================

	The galaxies of Compound X are filled with all manner of space pirates, 
bounty hunters, rogue robots and hostile aliens. Many an enemy intend to settle
their grievences with you by putting a bullet in you. These rules will explain
how that works.

===== Hitting The Dirt =====

	If a player or opponent is standing outside of cover and they are shot at, 
after the first firing action (assuming they didn't die or go unconscious), 
they immediately, 'Hit the Dirt'. When you Hit the Dirt, you dive to the ground,
going prone, within a 2m range of where you stood (DEX movement rules apply 
as normal). Hitting the dirt consumes the 1st action of their next turn.

==============================
Death, Dying, and Downed
==============================

	Oh no! You have less than 1 health point left! What now!?! The good news is 
you are not* dead yet. But you are doing what's known as "Bleeding Out". The 
first time your character falls below 1 hit point, you get 3 saving throws 
called Death Saving Throws (or 'DSTs' for short). You roll one saving throw per 
turn that you are Downed and these DSTs are not modified by any attribute. If you 
succeed a DST, (see 'Downed', below) you continue Bleeding Out; however, you get 
to roll again next turn. If you fail 3 DSTs, you die. Once you fail a DST, the 
next time you fall below 1 health point you only get 2 DSTs (2 failed throws and 
you die). If you failed a DST during the first two times you were downed and 
you are downed a third time, you only get 1 DST. You regain a DST by going a 
whole encounter without failing a DST. You can have a maximum of 3 saving throws 
at any one time.

Downed:
	The state of having less than one Health Point is called being "Downed." It 
is also sometimes called "Bleeding Out." They are equivalent. While a character 
is Downed, they cannot move, cannot stand under their own power, and fall prone 
if not supported by other means. They cannot speak, but can mumble 
incomprehensibly.

	Every turn that a character takes while they are downed, they must make a 
Death Saving Throw of DC 50. Success and failure of these throws is detailed 
above. Even if you had 5 health and took 80 damage, when you go down you go to 0
health. Any additional attacks you sustain will push you into negative health. 

Stabilize:
	For three actions, a character may choose an adjacent, Downed character and 
attempt to Stabilize them. That character makes DC 80 DEX-based skill check: 
Medicine for primarily organic targets, or Repair for primarily cybernetic 
characters. If successful, the target is revived and now has 1 HP, is no longer 
Downed, and may take Actions as normal within the initiative order. A character 
may be revived in a single encounter a number of times equal to half their Fort, 
minimum two. Past this limit, stabilized characters are Unconscious in addition 
to the other effects of Stabilization. Note that most persistent damage effects, 
like bleeds or burns, fall off of characters when they are Downed. If the 
stabilizing character starts stabilizing with their last action or two, 
finishing on the stabilizing character's subsequent turn, then the dying 
character does not need to make a death saving throw on the turn between that.

	If a character fails a stabilization check, nothing happens. It's just 
taking longer to stem the bleeding. On critical success (base Critical range 10), 
your excellent care allows you to choose whether the target counts this revival 
against their revivals per encounter limit. On critical failure (01-05 before 
modifiers), the bleeding (or equivalent) gets worse: the target must immediately 
roll an additional Death Save. If the total check is then still high enough to 
succeed and the target is still alive, they are then Stabilized as normal.

	Up to one character may assist with a stabilization check. Either involved 
character may expend one Medkit (for primarily organic targets) or one Repair Kit 
(for primarily mechanical targets) to grant +20 to the Medicine check. Feel free 
to scavenge one from the target, they probably won't make a fuss. One kit provides 
a bonus to all Stabilization attempts made on the same target in one round.

	Don't forget that a recently stabilized character may need to take actions to
retrieve a dropped weapon or stand back up if they have fallen.

*Some hazards can reduce you to zero health points and kill you 
instantly. Some examples are falling several stories, lava baptisms,
or having a space station dropped on you. Do not do these things. They are
also known to the state of California to cause cancer. 

==============================
Reloading
==============================

	When a gun runs out of ammunition, the user must pause to reload. "But how 
long do I gotta be outta the battle?" Great question!

	Each gun has a "Reload DC," rated based on the complexity and brevity of the 
weapon's reload. For example, an assault rifle, which has a very obvious 
magazine release button and protruding magazine, has an average DC of 30%. More 
complex weapons, such as high-precision sniper systems or exotic sub-machine 
guns might have a higher DC, maybe 40%. If the Player passes the reload, then 
the reload time is standard. For Box-Magazine fed Semi- and Fully-Automatic 
weapons, this is 2 Actions. Other, more complex weapons will specify their 
reload time. On a critical Weapons - [X] check to reload the weapon,
the reload time is halved (for Bolt-Actions it is reduced to 1 Action). On a 
failure, the reload time takes twice as long.

===== Combat Stat Modifiers for Ranged and Melee Accuracy =====

	These bonuses use a table instead of the more general attribute modifier 
equation, as combat accuracy rolls are played out on a d10 scale. Under normal 
conditions ranged combat uses the Perception combat modifier as described below. 
Melee combat uses Strength, Dexterity, and Fortitude.

== Combat Stat Modifier Table ==

+--------+-------------+
| Stat   | Stat Bonus  |
+--------+-------------+		
| 1      | -1.5	       |
+--------+-------------+
| 2      | -1	       |
+--------+-------------+
| 3-4    | -0.5	       |
+--------+-------------+	
| 5      |  0	       |	
+--------+-------------+	
| 6-7    |  0.5	       |	
+--------+-------------+	
| 8-9    |  1	       |	
+--------+-------------+	
| 10-11  |  1.5	       |	
+--------+-------------+	
| 12-13  |  2	       |	
+--------+-------------+	
| 14     |  2.5	       |		
+--------+-------------+
| 15     |  3	       |		
+--------+-------------+

	Drop any remaining decimal (0.5 or -0.5 becomes 0) -in other words- only use 
integers when you are writing down the final miss chances of your weapon(s). For 
example, let's say you have a basic SMG with miss chance brackets of 4, 5, and 6. 
Assuming you have 6 Perception, your PER bonus is 0.5 and thus, your gun's range 
miss chance brackets are:

	(4 - 0.5), (5 - 0.5), (6 - 0.5)  =  3.5, 4.5, 5.5

	If these are your final miss chances, you would have to drop the remainder 
and your slightly-above-average perception wouldn't make enough of a difference 
to affect your miss chances!

	But let's say you also have a Dot Sight that you can put on your SMG. The 
Dot Sight gives a bonus -0.5 range bracket miss chance (among other benefits). 
This means you now have the following range brackets:

	(4 - 0.5 - 0.5), (5 - 0.5 - 0.5), (6 - 0.5 - 0.5)  =  3, 4, 5

	Perfect! Now your Perception and Dot Sight bonuses, together, reduce your 
range bracket miss chances by 1 point. If you don't have any other bonuses (from 
other attachments, feats, or abilities) then you would write down 3, 4, 5 as 
your range bracket miss chances.

	If your gun has automatic and/or burst fire, you'd add its associated miss 
chances to your range bracket miss chances and separately write down those 
numbers (after all bonuses to range bracket miss chance and bonuses to automatic 
or burst fire). In other words, if you have a ranged weapon with semi-auto, 
burst, and automatic fire modes, then you should write down 3 sets of 3 miss
chances; one set for each of the 3 fire modes. For example, let's now assume 
your gun has a burst fire miss chance of 1 and an automatic fire miss
chance of 3, your ranged bracket miss chances should look something like this...

0-10m, 11-20m, 21-40m	range brackets
  3,     4,      5    	semi-auto miss chances
  4,     5,      6	burst fire miss chances
  6,     7,      8	automatic fire miss chances



===== Thrown Weapons =====

	These weapons work similarly to guns in that attackers add their combat PER 
mod to their accuracy, however, like melee attacks, if you roll a critical hit or 
3+ above your Miss Chance, your attack bypasses any armor the target is wearing. 
Thrown weapons benefit from Stealth Attacks normally (see basic rules).
	
	Thrown weapons use the same size categories as Melee weapons for 
determining proficiency, though a Two-handed throwing weapon would be 
rare indeed.

===== Grenades =====

	All grenades require an explosives skill of at least 6 to use.
You can 'cook' a grenade in your hand for 1 action to make it impossible for an
enemy to dodge.

	Gain +2 Accuracy if you are throwing under half of your grenade's max 
throwing distance. If you fail your throw within 1 miss chance of the minimum, 
roll d4 meters for how off-target the grenade throw is. If you fail your throw 
beyond 1 miss chance, roll a d10 instead.

	All grenades have a Reflex Modifier: -10


Stealth Attacks:

	If you are hidden (undetected by an opponent) when you initiate an attack 
action, you incur bonuses depending on the circumstances of the attack.

*Base Damage is typically the damage of the weapon without any other character 
bonuses, but Base Damage can be increased by certain classes and abilities.

**Increases to 200 max damage at level 10.
