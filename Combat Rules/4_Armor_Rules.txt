Armor
==============================

    You like being alive, but your adventures sometimes end up with you being
shot at. Luckily, most species in the galaxy have a technology specifically to
solve that age-old problem! These rules tell you what your armor does, and what
to do if an enemy succeeds in their attempts to shoot you.

===== ARMOR SYSTEMS =====
    Armor Systems are composed of an Armor Rig and a protective Armor Material. 
Having lots of armor may slow you down, but armor will prevent you from 
being easy prey. Armor Rigs can be broken down into 4 pieces: helmets,
chest rigs, arm rigs, and leg rigs. 

    Helmets mostly help for RP effects or holding night vision goggles.
The other 3 riggings provide ammunition space and (most rigs) provide
space for installing an Armor Material. Armor Materials must be purchased 
separately than Armor Rigs. Also, Armor systems do not include any protection
without an Armor Material. If you purchase more than one Material* to cover 
your whole body (installing in the Arm, Leg, and Chest Rigs, for example) it 
improves the Armor Coverage (% of Armor protection), but not the quantity of 
the Armor Strength (AS) or the Armor Piercing Level (APL). 

    For example: if you purchase a Chest Rig from the Medium Armor Systems
category and a Standard L1 Material, you'll have 40% coverage, 40 AS, and an 
APL of 1. Now, in addition, if you purchase the Leg Rig from the Medium Armor 
Systems and a Standard L1 Material, you'd have 55% coverage, 40 AS, and an
APL of 1.

*Note: you cannot mix-and-match Materials or Rig categories. Only one
kind of Material can be used for the one category of Rigging you are wearing.

===== WHERE IS MY AMMO STORAGE? =====

    If you are wearing any Armor Rigging, you have a certain amount of 
"Mag Space". When you are loading up your guns before a mission, you can decide 
how to arrange your Mag Space to suit your needs. "Mag Space" translates 1 to 1
into Primary Magazines, and 2 to 3 (or 1 to 1) into Secondary Magazines.

    For example, if I have a Chest Rig from the Recon Armor Systems category, I 
would have 5 Mag Space. I can turn that Mag Space into 3 Primary Magazine and 3
Secondary Magazine spaces, 5 Primary Magazine spaces, or any feasible combination. 

===== WHAT IS AN 'ADVANCED RIG'? =====

    Advanced (adv.) Rigs typically provide less Armor Coverage and Mag Space 
than their regular counterparts, but they allow you to attach Shield Generators,
Hard Point Equipment, and/or Cloaking Equipment. Advanced Rigs allow you to do
this by providing 'Hard Points'. Hard Points are special joints and fittings that
make it easy to attach equipment. When you purchase equipment, it will list how
many Hard Points it consumes. You can't attach more equipment than you have available
Hard Points.

    Hard Point Equipment/Shields/Cloaking often come in two sizes, "Primary Modules" and 
"Secondary Modules". After you purchase and install a Primary Module, you can also purchase
and install a Secondary Module(s) that augment the benefits of the Primary Module. The 
benefits are listed in the description of a given module. They do not mix and match;
Secondary Modules only work for the Primary Module they are designed for.
    Some modules have a "____ Skill Requirement". In order to operate the module, you
must have the required quantity of the given skill.

===== ARMOR RIGS =====

    Armor rigs cannot be worn in combination with other Rigs from different types, tactical 
vests, or EVA suits (for example: Recon Rigs can't be worn with Light Rigs). Some of the 
lighter Armor Rigs cannot hold Armor Materials, designated by "(*No Armor*)". Those rigs 
only provide more Mag Space or more Hard Points; they don't provide additional Armor Coverage.

===== EVA SUITS AND FLIGHT HELMETS =====

    Helmets may be worn with or added to Armor or Environment (EVA) suits.
EVA suits are air- and water-tight when combined with an EVA or flight helmet.
EVA suits are bulky and cannot be used with Armor Rigs, also, DEX skill checks
have a -10% penalty and movement is reduced in RP. If the suit is hit more 
times than its "Suit Integrity" rating, it will no longer be able to maintain
air pressure (player health has to be damaged in order for "Suit Integrity" to
count a hit). Suits traditionally come in white, yellow or red.

===== SHIELD GENERATORS =====

    Shields cover the wearer with a transparent field which blocks 
100% of incoming Laser damage, and 50% of Plasma weapon damage, 
as long as the Shield isn't drained of its "Shield Strength".
Traditionally, a Shield unit consists of a generator pack which 
is generally the size of a small backpack, and some field
stabilizers that extend the field over the body. Once the
Shield's capacitor units are exhausted, the Shield breaks and
needs a while to recharge. If the user maintains their Shield 
without letting it break, they can avoid the costly recharge time.
For more information, please see section "Shields" in the 
Basic Rules document.

    Armor consists of 3 concepts: Armor Points (APs), Armor Piercing level (APL),
and % Coverage. Starting from the end, Coverage is simply the percentile that 
you have to roll under to see if armor was hit. If the attack misses armor, or 
rolls over 50%, it does half damage because the bullet is hitting a less vital 
part of the body. If the attack hits armor: Armor Piercing level (APL) comes 
into play.

== Armor Piercing Level (APL) ==

    APL is a unitless number that represents how well a weapon can pierce armor or
how well armor can block bullets. If the attackers weapon's APL is less than the
defenders armor's APL, all damage is blocked. If the weapon's APL is greater than
or equal to the armor's APL, then Armor Points (APs) come into play. 

== Armor Points (APs) ==

    APs are, effectively, your armor's ability to slow down projectiles as they
pass through it. Whenever armor is successfully pierced, all damage is first inflicted
on APs. Once the APs are used up, all remaining damage goes to health. APs refresh at the
start of the armor wearer's turn.

===== Shields =====

    If you are looking to defend against Lasers or Plasma, you're in the right 
place. Every laser-toting plasma-fuming space hooligan will be looking to turn 
you into space-bacon ('spacon' for short) on your adventure; shields will slow 
that process down. If you are hit with a laser, shields absorb 100% of the 
damage, reducing the shield's strength by the damage taken. If you are hit with 
a plasma weapon, the shield absorbs 50% of the damage, and the rest passes 
through to the next line of defense (either armor [if present] or the 
character's body). If the Shield's Strength is reduced to 0, all remaining 
damage passes through unabated.

    As long as the Shield's Strength isn't reduced to 0, the shield will 
recharge 'Recharge Rate / Turn' number of points at the start of the wearer's 
turn. If the Shield's Strength is reduced to 0, you must wait a "Shield Restart 
Time" number of turns before the shield will restart at "Recharge Rate" 
strength. If you get hit with a weapon/by melee during that time, you must start 
your "Shield Restart Time" over again. 

    If you don't want to wait that long, at the start of your turn you can pay 
the "Fast Recharge Nanites" cost to restart your shields. Or if your Shield's 
Strength is just damaged, at the start of your turn you can pay the "Fast 
Recharge Nanites" cost to boost the Shield's Strength by an extra "Recharge Rate 
/ Turn" (in other words, 2x "Recharge Rate / Turn" instead of the normal 1x).
