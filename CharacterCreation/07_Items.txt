Plasma cutter / Blow Torch ($450):
    Cut through steel, aluminum, etc unless it is specifically a hardened 
object. Cut through up to 1 inch of steel in 2 full turns, 2 inches in 3 full 
turns. A basic 2-inch thick chain link would take 3 turns to cut through. To 
open a man-sized hole in 1 inch thick steel would take 10 full turns.

Door Ram ($300): 
    Add 50 to a roll when attempting to kick open a door. Must have STR 8 to 
carry or use.

Bolt Cutters ($80):
    Used to cut through chain links, locks, cables, etc.

    A sturdy, 2m long fiberglass fishing pole with a reel, fishing line and a
sharp hook. Bait not included. An expert angler could potentially cast this out
to 6 meters.  

Pneumatic Door Press ($700):
    Opens sliding, pneumatically controlled doors up to Militarized Level 
(airlock specific doors exluded)

Engineer's replacement Extruder Tool ($670):
    Sometimes things happen and an engineer's favorite tool gets lost, stolen or 
damaged. Replacing them is expensive, but not impossible. Please note that 
buying an extruder does not mean that one knows how to use it to follow 
Engineer processes; i.e., a Gunslinger who buys an extruder can't construct
IEDs with it.

3D image builder, Static ($650):
    A 3m^3 framework that will build a rudimentary  3d image of whatever is 
inside it, exportable to a portable device.

3D image builder, Portable ($800):
    Builds a 3D image of what its being pointed at, will need to see the object 
from multiple angles to capture the whole object. Up to 20m^3 of space.

==============================
Wearables
==============================

Night Vision Goggles ($300):
    IR visibility for low light conditions. Resolution clouds after 100m.

Gas Mask ($300):
    Prevents the inhalation of noxious or toxic air-borne compunds. Reduce PER 
based rolls (including strike rolls) by 10.

Hazmat Suit, Disposable ($60):
    A white unitard that covers over your hands, feet, arms, legs, body and 
head. The suit zips up in the back and has a elastic drawstring that fits around
a gas mask or rebreather. The outer layer of the suit has a no-stick covering
except on the soles of the feet and the gloves. The inner lining is waterproof
and airtight. The material makes a crinkling sound that gives a -20 to stealth
checks. Wearing the suit correctly provides immunity to airborne gas attack or
infection. For example, provides immunity from tear gas, The Doctor's 
Contaminate Area Procedure, etc. The suit provides no armor coverage and if the
wearer takes damage the suit ruptures and no longer provides immunity.

grenade.

Wall Charge ($120):

surrounding the charge or take 70 explosive damage. Thicknesses of several 
materials one wall charge can breach through are listed below.

around a door handle. 1 meter to wrap around a grenade. 4 meters to create a 
wall breaching pad (Explosives 50 DC).

==============================
Miscellaneous Items
==============================

    Examples of RP trinkets include cigarettes, a lighter, cards, a wallet, an 
ID pass, etc. Basically items that cannot be used in combat, but would have 
great value in RP. These cost nothing, but you can only have a maximum of 2 
items at start.

    Other misc. items are available for sale in the world. While you're playing 
be on the lookout for shops or characters who might sell you more things. If you
want to buy other starting equipment, ask your DM if something specific is 
available and how much it might cost. Equipment that you start with generally
depends on your character's fist mission. 

20m of Nylon Rope ($30):
    A light, sturdy rope 20 meters long which can hold a tension of 400lbs 
without snapping.

Trulight LED flashlight	($22):
    A metal black flashlight with bright LED bulbs. Illuminates up to 15m of 
bright light.

Smart Phone	($180):
    A touch screen, microphone and speaker in a plastic case. Reception may vary 
by location.

DC to hack with skill points in hacking: 30
DC to hack without skill points: 80

Road Flare ($15):
    A phosphorus red stick with a strike pad at the end. Will put off soft red 
light for 5m in every direction for about an hour. Burns in rain, mud, even 
burns underwater. Don't touch the end or you'll take 10 fire damage.

Comfy Bed Roll ($55):
    An insulated and padded bedroll. Great for missions which last more than a
couple of days. Not rated for temperatures above 43 degrees C or below -5 C.

Walkie-Talkie ($45):
    A simple 30 channel push to talk hand held radio. Has a 2km range. Comes 
with a handy clip to attach to a belt or combat harness. Simple encryption can
be broken with a DC 45 hacking skill check.

Radio Headset ($65):
    A slightly more sophistocated communication system. Fits well under most 
combat helmets and is available in different sizes for most races or species.
Uses passive filtering to reduce background noise. Capable of broadcasting
while receiving. Better encryption means it takes a hacking check of DC 64
to listen in. A DC check of 78 to make a call on an enemy line. Range of 3km.

Integrated Remote Verbal Communication Module ($80):
    Cybernetic customers such as cyborgs or Security Droids may purchase and
install an integrated radio broadcasting module. These have a range of 2km
and a DC of 82 to hack into, since they can use the host's own encryption 
hardware.

Subdermal Mic ($230):
    The best combat communication system available on the public market. A
microphone is actually injected under the users' skin and rests next to the
combatant's jaw bone. It uses the vibration of the jaw to send clear voice
sounds even over cacophanous gunfire. A similar speaker is injected in the
back of the cheek near the ear. Impossible to see with the naked eye without 
invading the wearer's personal space. DC 140 to hack.

Universal Translation Device ($160):
    The Universal Translation Device is proprietary and fairly rare. A character
will likely have a hard time finding them for purchase until level 10.
    A small cell-phone sized device with a small screen, camera, speaker and
universal audio port. It can interface with any of the radio systems above or be
used in ambient mode where it repeats anything it hears ambiently in the 
language that it is set to. In synch mode, the translator listens to both its 
mic and the coms that it is tied into and pipes the translated voices to the 
com's speaker. Which means that the translations piped to a subdermal mic can
only be heard by the person using it but the translations piped to a 
walkie-talkie might be overheard.
    A given universal translator can only hold 10 languages at a time while 
offline from the net cortex, and can slowly learn a language as it hears it, but
will have a very hard time translating a previously unknown language.
    Hacking the device requires physical access unless it is attached to a pwned 
device. In either the case of physical access or connection to a pwned device, 
the disruption DC is 50 and the pwn DC is 90. A Disrupted translator will only 
broadcast static in place of foreign languages, a pwned translator will spoof 
words that the hacker wishes it to.
