Humans
==============================

	Humans are a tenacious species from the Sol System. They come in a variety
of shapes, sizes and colors. Humans are an organic species of the class 
"Mammalia" who must eat, drink and sleep in order to survive. 

===== Apearance/Anatomy =====

	Humans are bipedal mammals with opposable thumbs and no tail. Their fur 
grows so thin in most places, that they appear bald all over with the periodic 
exception of the tops of their heads. 

	Humans are of middling height and weight among the species that are 
encountered in the galaxies of Compound X. They typically run between 1.5m and 
1.9m and weigh 49 to 128 kilograms. 

	They have an internal calcium skeleton and an extensive network of biologic
tubes that carry fluids like blood, bile, lymph, air and food through their 
bodies. The rupture of these tubes and spilling of these fluids is generally to
be avoided. They have an average lifespan of about 100 Sol years, depending on
their profession and location.

Types:
* Biological
* Mammalian
* Warm-blooded 
* Omnivorous 

===== Society =====

	Humans originated on the planet Earth in the Sol system. They have been 
exploring space to some degree for almost 800 years, settling their own Terran 
Empire after the catastrophic events that changed the Earth.

	In general, adult humans range from 5’ to 6’5”. They can be larger or 
smaller, but individuals of those types are generally rare.

	They are an incredibly prolific and opportunistic species, having 
completely terraformed and colonized over half a dozen planets and their 
respective moons. With many more Terran planets on the rise, they already dwarf 
the small Opaleite and Tundari civilizations.

	Humans are very culturally dissimilar to each other. Even more so than 
most other species, most likely due to their rapid expansion. As such, it is 
impossible to pick out the cultural traits that influence humans as a whole. 
Central government is important to the large groups of humans, though smaller 
factions and settlements on the rim of their empire do not seem to care about 
the rules and regulations of their governing powers.

===== Language: Various ===== 

	Most humans speak what is known as Terran Common. In addition, humans 
have countless different languages that they use to communicate with others of 
their peers. The majority of humans speak multiple languages, whether alien or 
domestic. Humans are very good at repeating sounds that are initially unnatural 
to them. The language centers of their brains are highly developed and 
well-used. 

	Terran Common, Eastern Common, Westlich, and Mandar are the most common 
human languages.

===== Names ===== 

	Humans can be named in as many ways as there are Terran languages. 
Usually, these names have some significant meaning to the parents, but that is 
not always the case. There is no standard of naming that is generally agreed 
upon.

== Human Name Examples ==

* Matthew Kesler
* Lupita Ugara
* Tomoyo Usagi

===== Passives =====

===== Available Traits =====

Pitching Arm:
	All humans have the inherent bone and muscle structure necessary for 
extremely accurate throwing. Not all humans practice this technique, but you 
are one who has mastered this seemingly simple aspect of your anatomy.
[Must have at least 5 DEX; Negates the aiming action necessary to throw accurately]

Stubborn: 
	All Humans have a hardiness to them that cannot always be explained 
by logic. Some humans are just plain hard to kill, for no other apparent 
reason than they just refuse to die. 
[Roll with Advantage on Death Saving Throws]

Human Sub-Species
==============================

===== Terrans =====

Size: Medium
Home System: Keplar

Appearance: 
	Heavily resembling the historic humans, there is little variation 
from even 20th century humans in this pool. The Terrans left Sol behind in 
the 24th Century, forming a new colony in the Keplar system. 


== Available Traits ==

Very Normal: 
	Blending in has always come naturally to you. People tend to trust you. 
You seem to belong no matter where you find yourself, and have a talent for
projecting confidence whether you believe it or not.
[Increase your skill in Deception by 15 and skill in Persuasion by 10.]

Sixth Sense:
	Colloquially often known as the ‘gut’ instinct, sixth sense is that 
feeling that many Terrans get when they feel something is off. There are 
different levels of Sixth Sense, and many function in different ways. Some 
Terrans get goosebumps, while others experience a hair-raising feeling; it 
can be very hard to get anything past Humans with this sense tuned. 
[Once per Long Rest, you may ask the GM if a situation or proposed action
feels disproportionately deceptive or lethal to the character.]


===== Eastern Earthlings =====

Size: Small/Medium
Home System: Sol

	Inhabiting the areas of Earth east of the equator, these humans 
have adapted to the humid, swampy heat of their half of the planet. Small 
and lean, these humans rarely reach over 5’ in height, and are much lighter 
than their Terran counterparts. As the new earth conditions have stabilized, 
these humans have begun to rebuild some sense of agriculture, but have
only recently ceased their nomadic patterns.

== Available Traits ==

Endurance: 
	Generations of Nomadic behavior have made moving long distances 
easy for those of Eastern Earthling descent. 

    Once per engagement, your Sprinting actions during one turn do not incur the 
normal penalties.

===== Western Earthlings =====

Size: Large
Home System: Sol

	Living as close to the equator as they dare, these humans are 
confined to the western edge of the geostorm center. Some have spread further 
west, but most do not like the absence of sunlight. As their climate tends to 
be cold to freezing, these Earthlings are larger overall than their Terran 
counterparts.


== Available Traits ==

Quick Constriction: 
	Living in an area ravaged by lighting storms, these humans have 
developed rapid pupil constriction and dilation. This increases their 
resistance to not only lightning blasts, but to flash-bangs. 
[Duration of Blindness condition halved. Gain Advantage on Saving Throws to
avoid being Blinded ]

Frost-Free:
	The hardy life lived by your people has encouraged an innate 
resistance to cold.
[Take half-damage from cold Thermal damage. Roll with advantage against any
adverse effects related to cold, including Saving Throws to avoid being
Frozen.]
