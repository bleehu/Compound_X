cultures dot the surrounding systems ranging from corporations to patriarchies 
to pirate anarchies.

Tundari
Society: Tribal system, lead by a council of elders.

Homeworld: Tundaaari
A dry, searingly hot planet covered in planes and deserts. 70% of the planet 
is covered in water. The planet's axis of rotation is more or less upright 
relative to its binary star system. The North pole points more towards the 
suns, and as such is a cooked wasteland, while the south pole is left in a 
more temperate, jungle climate. 90% of the annual rainfall on the planet 
occurs on this jungly southern continent.

Native Species: Tundarin
This Feline-esque species is covered in a soft, short fur ranging in many 
colors, from browns, to oranges, blacks, grays, etc. And a multitude of patterns
(striped, splotched, dotted, etc.). They have whiskers, and very sharp teeth. 
Their eyesight is very good, and they have low-light vision. Their build is 
generally more slender and graceful, but there have been bulkier Tundarin 
observed.

Society: Tribal with leading council of elders
The planet as a whole is unified under the banner of space exploration. there 
are many nation-states coming from historical tribes. Each nation-state is led 
by a council of elders, and a head elder is elected from each council to sit 
in on the grand council which overlooks issues on a planet-wide scale. They 
are hunters by nature, with a close tie to nature. Their cities typically 
blend in with the environment, whether it be large tree cities or hanging 
cliff cities.
They typically believe in spiritualism, and their level of science has been 
brought about by their religious leaders. Science is seen as a result of their
religion, rather than an explanation of it. This being the case, science is 
well taught and understood by most all Tundarin, and higher tier and newer 
prototype devices are revered as religious artifacts.
As far as the war goes, the Tundarin have been more peaceful towards humans, 
and have recently opened trade routes with the humans. While uncommon, 
Tundarin have been known to mingle with humans on occasion. Those who do have 
an understanding of Human Basic.

//============================================================
Cyborg

Society: Cybernetics advanced rapidly over the last 200 years, and it is not 
uncommon to see Cyborgs walking amongst crowds. Most of society looks down on 
their augmented brethren, and in some places they are outcasts completely. Be 
warned if you take this race, you will be discriminated against at some point.

Type: Enhanced Organic.
Size: Medium
Speed: Normal+
Starting Stat Points: 40
Stat Modifiers: See Below
Language: ECSC Standard

Racial Traits:
Pick any three augments (you may take a single augment no more than 2 times, 
or a combination of multiple augments. For example Occular Augment and Speed 
Geared Fine Motor Controls II might help a melee fighter increase both damage 
and hit chance.):
    Occular Augmentation: +1 Perception, Darkvision 20m.
    Enhanced Speed: +1 movement.
    Enhanced Strength: +1 STR, metal arms, legs, or both.
    Neural Implant: +1 Intelligence.
    Speed Geared Fine Motor Controls: +1 DEX, no augment to movement speed.
    Skeletal Support Structure: +1 FORT.
    Implanted Weapon: Pick a pistol from the basic weapons list. This pistol 
    is implanted in a limb. You may manipulate your limb to use this weapon at
    the cost of 1 action. While the weapon is out, that limb does not 
    operate at its normal capacities. Hands would not grasp, legs would not 
    superbly support you, etc. Subrtact the price of the weapon from your 
    class starting money. The weapon can be upgraded to another pistol with a 
    DC 25 Biomechanics check, or a DC 50 Mechanics check. It can be upgraded 
    to any CQB weapon with a DC 50 Biomechanics or DC 75 Mechanics check.
    Integrated multitool: Your fingers hide a basic toolkit, including low-
    speed motorized screwdrivers, soldering iron, wrenches, quantum spanner, 
    toothpick, pliers, sharp edge, lock pick, etc. If it fits in a leatherman,
    its plausible that it would be in this toolkit.
    Internal Reinforcing: Critical Damage threshold +5, +5 base health.
    External Reinforcing: 5 DR passive, potential for RP abilities.

Cyborgs share all weaknesses with their base race, generally humans. They 
additionally are weak against electric damage taking an extra 50% damage.(10
damage would become 15). They are also susceptible to hacking, although they 
would not come under control, they would merely loose the use of their 
augmentations and any affected limbs. DC 80 Hack check.
Once at level 3, and every 5 levels thereafter a Cyborg may purchase an 
additional augment at the cost of $2000. They must see a cybernetics expert to
have this augment installed.

//============================================================
Opaleite

Opaleites are so named by the humans who encountered them for the way the light 
diffracts in their large irises, giving the impression of an opal. A wide-eyed 
amphibious species that prefers to live entirely in the water. They come in a 
diverse set of body types and colors depending on where they live and which 
family they come from. The carry a double set of gills, one set in the neck and 
one set beneath the lungs that can be closed and sealed, much like the ears and 
nostrils of aquatic mammals. Unlike their mammalian counterparts, these people
can function both underwater and above water. When in the water, the lungs merely
act as a bypass for the water running through the gills and gives it a way to 
exit; while outside of the water, the gill flaps close and the lungs function as 
mammals’ do. They are incredibly sensitive to sunlight, and burn very easily when 
not in the water. 
    Native to the once Ocean planet Trioch II, these beings evolved to the 
changing of their planet as a massive solar flare from their star shifted the 
magnetic fields holding in the atmosphere were shaken and ultimately disrupted, 
causing the oceans to begin evaporating. With their oceans slowly dissipating 
through the leak in the atmosphere, they have begun migrating to the nearby 
Trioch IV, also mostly oceanus, which is out of immediate danger from the star. 
Now, they live in both the oceans and the well-shaded estuaries on Trioch IV. A 
few stubborn stragglers remain on Trioch II, which is slowly becoming a sandy, dry 
wasteland with very little atmosphere. 


Trioch II is now a place for venturing archaeologists to come and investigate the 
way the Opaleites used to live. 

Racial Bonuses:
Waterbreathing
+1 base FORT, +10 to reflex rolls. Due to their rapid evolution, Opaleites have 
a much easier time adjusting to the physical obstacles presented to them. 
-10 to perception rolls above water.

attacks.

sight of you. This takes a tremendous amount of effort and you take a -10 
penalty if tired or bloodied. This ability will temporarily scramble a robot’s 
visual cortex, but they can adjust rapidly.

dash, take a free melee strike at an enemy within range.
Ability: Toxic Poof - Your particularly stretchy scales allow for a rapid 
expansion of your body, protruding the toxic spines that otherwise lay 
harmlessly under your scales. You expand to twice your size and anything that 
touches you takes 10 dmg +5 poison dmg per turn until cleansed. If you barrel 
into anything while poofed, it takes 30 damage +10 poison damage per turn and 
must roll a shock save DC of 50 to not be paralyzed. You are easier to hit while
in this state and take an additional %10 damage from any damage done to you.
