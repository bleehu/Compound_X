Player Tactical Movement Interface and Guide
==============================
This document is considered an "optional" or "supplemental"
document. The information contained within is not necessary to be
successful or to have fun in Compound_X, but it will augment the
natural abilities of players and provide them with advantages over
NPCs.

==============================
Introduction
==============================
Moving across a battle field is an art which enables a team to perform at much 
more optimal levels. The key thing to remember is that communication helps 
everyone. There different ways to move a team, and different situations ins 
which to use them. This document won't go too in depth about scenarios and 
what movement to use in them, but will introduce the reader to key-words to 
inform both the team and the GM of what they want to do exactly.

==============================
Movement
==============================

Possibly the most important thing to remember when in a combat scenario, or 
when you suspect that an encounter is imminent is to stick to cover. This is 
pretty self-explanatory, but sticking to cover makes you less likely to die. 
Windows, doorways, crates, cars, etc. are all good examples of cover.

==============================
Maneuvers
==============================

Pieing Corners
    Pieing a corner is the act of rounding a corner in such a way that you are 
    constantly aware of any targets around the corner. Rather than just 
    steepping around the corner and then checking to see whats there, imagine 
    dividng the corner into sections, like slices of pie. The combatant would 
    take small steps, "eating" small pieces of pie and checking each 20 degree 
    or 30 degree section for contacts as they move. This allows a more 
    thorough examination of the environment while exposing less of your body to
    a potential threat. This maneuver is performed with the gun in "up" 
    position so that the combatant is ready to engage any threats that are 
    discovered.

Peeking Corners
    Peeking a corner is a quick way of checking whats around it. The combatant 
    stands or kneels next to the corner they want to peak, and quickly moves 
    their head out of cover, lightly scanning the area for about a half 
    second. Generally this is done with the weapon in ready position or 
    holstered, as you want to be moving as little weight as possible to 
    minimize the time you are exposed.

Flanking
    Flanking is the act of attacking from the opponent's side or rear, where 
    they are more blind and less able to react to a threat. In order for a 
    flank to have maximum success, those doing the flanking should take the 
    enemy by surprise. Stealth or concealment are good options here.

Supporting Fire / Covering Fire
    Supporting fire is when an ally lays fire downrange in order to discourage 
    the enemy from firing back or moving. It is useful for allowing movement 
    of allied troops, either for a push, a flank, or a retreat. If a team 
    wants to move half of their assets to a different location that would 
    provide them with a tactical advantage, they might coordinate with each 
    other and tell the GM "We are going to provide covering fire for X, Y and 
    Z to do W." The GM may then have their enemy NPCs roll shock saving throws 
    or just allow the enemies to be supressed for 1 turn. Additionally the GM 
    may ask that those providing the covering fire expend more ammunition than 
    they would normally consume in a regular turn of firing.

Leap-Frogging
    Leap frogging is a form of movement which enables a team to maximize 
    coverage while moving. It is slower than just moving in a formation, but 
    the group is less exposed as a whole. The group all take cover in some 
    sort of line or column formation. The person or persons at the end of the 
    line or collumn move to the front, while everyone else covers them. This 
    pattern repeats as necessary until the group reaches their goal. This can 
    be either a more secure area, or an extraction point. Combine this 
    maneuver with solid stealth checks for an impenitrible defense, although 
    the group will be slowed drastically.

Changing Levels
    When taking cover behind an object which you can peek around or under, you 
    may want to change your attack height or attack position. This is 
    especially useful if you are pinned by a machine gun or sniper. Normally 
    we think of using cover exactly as it is presented to us. If there is a 
    pillar, you stand behind it and shoot around it. For a car you might kneel 
    behind it and shoot over it. It is also possible in these situations to 
    fire from alternative locations. This provides you with one main advantage:
    firing from an unexpected position or angle can catch an enemy off-guard. 
    Think about laying down and peeking around a corner close to the ground to 
    fire, or firing underneath a car.
