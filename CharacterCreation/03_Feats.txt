== Bulltrue ==
Prerequisites: 

* Must have Shotgun training

	If an enemy moves from being at least 4m from you to being less than 3m from 
you, and you have a loaded shotgun drawn, you may fire at them as a free 
action (negate the pump of your shotgun, if one is necessary). If the target 
is bloodied after the attack, they may not make a melee attack against you with 
their next action.

to Skill Checks in combat.

== Combat Expertise [Support] ==
Prerequisites:

*  None

	+20% bonus to skill checks for class-related tasks in combat. (If you are a 
medic, this would apply to medicine but it wouldn't apply to hacking, etc.). -1 accuracy with Guns or Melee in combat.

== Concussive Maintenance ==
Prerequisites: 

*  20 skill in Repair OR Engineer class. 
*  STR 4

repair something. You can use concussive maintenance once per target, per 
encounter.

== Conceal Weapon == 
Prerequisites: 
*  None

	Make a stealth check to hide your chosen pistol, shotgun, or SMG on your 
person. To succeed, you must pass a DC 19 check. Total roll determines DC for an
enemy to actively search you and find your hidden weapon.

== Desperate Crawl ==
Prerequisites:
*  None

	When downed instead of not being able to move you may crawl half of your 
move speed or 3m every two actions whichever distance is shorter. You still 
cannot speak, and you cannot take any other action. Death saving throws are 
not actions, and must be rolled normally. You also get a +10% bonus to Death
Saving Throws

== Double Tap == 
Prerequisites:

*  None 

	Whenever your hit falls into critical hit range*, fire another bullet as a 
free action, foregoing the normal bonus-damage from a critical hit. The extra 
bullet automatically hits the target if your first bullet does. But the extra 
bullet does not trigger any other effects and cannot be used to double tap 
again. This feat only works with Semi-Auto weapons. It cannot be used with 
Single-Action Revolvers, Bolt Action, Pump-Action, Full-Auto weapons, etc.

*If you have a critical hit range greater than or equal to 3, only rolls of 8 or 
more will trigger Double Tap. One exception: the max critical hit range of 3 can 
be increased to 4 by the feat "Never Tell Me the Odds". If you have a critical 
hit range of less than 3, then critical hit range applies normally. 

== Dual Wield ==
Prerequisites:

*  DEX 6

	Maybe you've got a bigger corpus collosum and your right brain and left brain
are in higher sync than most people; or maybe you've seen too many John Woo
holomovies. Either way, you've managed to effectively fight using a weapon
in each hand. 

	The weapons must be of the same type, either two pistols, two smgs, two light
or one-handed melee weapons, etc. Additionally the sum of the strength requirements 
must be equal to or less than your Carry Strength. While Dual Weilding, you cannot 
take the grapple Action nor the Disarm Action. Any time you would attack with a 
reaction or if an ability of yours or an ally's would give you a free attack, you
may only attack with one of your dual wielded weapons, but you may pick which one
to use. 

	While wielding two guns, you may fire both at the same time at the same target 
with a -3 accuracy for each weapon. You may not target more than one target at 
a time. Reloading while dual wielding adds 20 to the difficulty of the reload.

	While dual wielding two melee weapons you may make a melee attack with each
as normal in the same Action, with a -2 to your melee accuracy for each. If you 
are attacked with a melee attack, you may only use one of your melee weapon's 
accuracies as a bonus to your defense. You do get to pick which weapon you would
like to use to defend though. 

	In addition, this feat lets you take the 'Dual Guard' Action as the last 
Action of your turn so long as you are weilding two melee weapons. If you do so, 
you spend a whole turn "putting up your dukes" and preparing to block attacks 
with both weapons. Mechanically, this gives you the guard bonus from both weapons
as well as an extra +2 to your guard DC for having two weapons to block with. 

== Empty the Mag ==
Prerequisites:

*  None

	It happens. You aren't quite sure if you can hit your target perhaps, or 
maybe you round that corner and are staring down the barrel of an enemy AR-68.
Whatever the case, you need to dump the mag in their face to guarantee your 
safety. Roll to pass a DC 30% DEX check. on success, you may fire off the 
remainder of your clip or magazine (Applies only to weapons with a semi-automatic
mode, maximum 10 shots). Roll hits for each shot. Using this feat takes 
3 actions, and must be completed in the span of one turn. After using 
this feat, the user must reload their weapon for it to be effective again. 
Can only be used once per encounter, LVL number of times per day. At level 5 
and beyond, can be used twice per encounter.

== Enhanced Neural Interface == 
Prerequisites:

*  INT 3

	As a free action (in or out of combat) you can use any keyboard, plug into a 
terminal, or use a monitor to perform a computer inquiry or operation. 
+15% to ONE pertinent skill check (hacking, etc.) while using this feat,
to be chosen at the time of taking this feat.

== Fish To Water ==
Prerequisites:

*  Fort > 2

	Maybe you took a lot of swimming lessons when you were little, maybe you
were on the college swim team, or maybe your military training had an 
emphasis on endurance and core strength developed in the pool. In any case,
you gain 10 skill in swimming and a bonus +15 to checks when holding your
breath. You also ignore movement penalties from wading through deep liquids.
These bonuses increase to 20 skill in swimming and 20 bonus to holding one's 
breath after level 7.

== First Shot Counts ==

Prerequisites:

*  LCK 6

	When reloading, if your reload roll is higher than an 80 (including any 
applicable skills) or if you roll inside your critical success range, then your 
first shot is an automatic critical hit + 10 bonus damage, for a total of 30 
bonus damage and other possible critical effects. 

    (Instead, if you have Double Tap, you get +10 bonus damage for each Double 
Tap bullet). You have to reload a fresh magazine in order to trigger the bonus 
again. In other words, you cannot use First Shot Counts more times in one 
encounter than the number of fresh magazines you are carrying. If your weapon 
damages an area, First Shot Counts does not take effect.

== Focus Energy == 
Prerequisites:

*  None

	Spend 1 Action to increase the effects of a spell or Nanite based

trick and it turns out has some surprising applications in combat. You gain 10
skill in the DEX skill Performance - Juggling. If you don't have another
weapon drawn when you draw a throwing weapon, you may attempt to juggle that
weapon. If you choose to do so, you must attempt a DC 60 Juggling skill 
check. On success, you may draw three of the same type of thrown weapon at
once and use each as if you had drawn them normally. If you fail, you drop one
of the weapons at your feet and launch the other two in random directions. You
also gain a +1 to accuracy with thrown weapons and a +10 to stealth checks to attack
quietly with thrown weapons.

== Last Shot Counts ==
Prerequisites:

*  PER 5

character that threw it. First, attempt a luck roll of DC 15. If you fail, the
grenade goes off with you standing right next to it. If you succeed, roll a d10

action. HOWEVER, you must shout your Motto or the Name when you perform this 
move. And hey, keep this move on the DL unless it is absolutely necessary to 
be used. You wouldn't want posers to copy it. (Note: this is an RP'd action 
meant to be performed in CQC, not simply aiming your rifle at their head 
and squeezing the trigger while shouting "BOOM HEADSHOT!" Please ask for 
GM permission when using this feat.)

== Sixth Sense ==
Prerequisites:

*  LCK 6

	You have uncanny knack for reading situations and making accurate decisions

the die.

==============================
Weapon Expertise Feats:					
==============================
		
	These feats represent dedicated training with a particular class of weapon, 
and offer bonuses based on the relevant Weapons skill (Weapon skills are listed 
in "06_Skills.txt"). Each feat offers a set of bonuses related to using that type of 
weapon (and only that type of weapon), and each bonus requires the character to have 
a number of points in the relevant Weapon skill. A character with 0 points in 
Weapons - Pistols would gain only one benefit, while 60 points would benefit from 
them all. The feats are formatted as a list of "X: Benefit", where X is the number of 
points required in the corresponding Weapon skill to gain the benefit.
	
	Weapon Expertise feats require proficiency with the weapon type, but otherwise 
have no prerequisites. Note that as all characters are proficient with Unarmed Strike, 
Melee Expertise effectively has no prerequisite.

== Pistol Expertise ==	

0:	+5m to ranges R1 & R2. If this would cause R2 to be greater than R3, 
	also set R3 equal to the new R2.
12:	May use Weapons - Pistol (Int) in place of Stealth for checks made to prevent 
	enemies from noticing your Pistol fire.
24:	Reduce the Reload check penalty imposed by the Dual-Wield / Akimbo feats 
	by 10 when dual-wielding pistols.
36:	+1 to Accuracy rolls at all ranges.

60:	+10% Base damage. If you succeed on an Accuracy roll by at least 3 or score 
	an Extra-Critical, treat the enemy's armor as having APL 0 for that attack.

== Submachine Gun Expertise ==

0:	+5m to ranges R1 & R2. If this would cause R2 to be greater than R3, 
	also set R3 equal to the new R2.
12:	May use Weapons - SMG (Cha) in place of Intimidate for checks to intimidate 
	a target you are suppressing with an SMG.
24:	+10 Gun Reflex to one SMG you are wielding.
36:	+2 to Accuracy rolls at all ranges while firing automatically (not burst).
48:	+15m to range R3 while firing semi-automatically.
60:	+10% Base damage. While suppressing an enemy, if you are shot at, after 
	the first Action of fire you may spend a reaction to duck behind cover 
	within 5m. This ends your suppression.

== Shotgun Expertise  ==

0:	+5m to range R1. If this would cause R1 to be greater than R2, 
	also set R2 equal to the new R1.
12:	May use Weapons - Shotgun (Dex) in place of Acrobatics for checks to execute 
	a physical maneuver following violent entry of a room.

	reload by one Action, stacking with other reductions (such as from 
	critical success), to a minimum of one Action.
36:	Negate the hip-firing Accuracy penalty against enemies within R1 while 
	firing spreading shot.

	During a move action, +1 movement speed per X (up to a max of +10 movement),
for that action only. This feat can only be used once per turn.
Adrenaline Rush can be taken again to reduce the Nanite cost to 2*X.

== Aimed Shot [8 Nanites] ==
Prerequisites:

*  PER 6

	Use your Nanites during an Aim action to help you more carefully aim at the target. 
Automatically critical hit on your next shot, if you hit. This is akin to seeing 
a chink in armor and aiming for it, or shooting a target's arm so they cannot use their
weapon, etc.

== Bunker [25 Nanites] ==
Prerequisites:

*  Hacker or
*  Knowledge - Nanites at 40

	Add -3 accuracy to a piece of cover for 4 turns.

== Combat Roll [30 Nanites] ==
Prerequisites:

*  DEX 5

	Move 6m in one action, no more, no less. Enemies attacking you have a -2 
accuracy and a -20% penalty to reflex rolls when attacking you during the 
roll and for the turn after you use this feat, and you have a -2 accuracy for 
the action after this feat ends. If this malus would not run out until after 
this turn, its effect wraps, around to the beginning of your next turn. Cannot 
be used in concert with Run 'N' Gun.

== Cover Slide [15 Nanites] ==
Prerequisites:

*  DEX 4

	Move up to your speed and end next to a barrier behind which you can take
cover. You hunker or go prone behind that cover as a free action. Cannot 
be used in concert with Run 'N' Gun.

== Flash Dance [10*X Nanites] ==
Prerequisites:

*  Level 3

	For 2 Actions, the user can make Lvl/2 (round up) number of attacks, up to a 
max of 6, with their melee weapon(s). The attacks must take place within a 5m 
space, rolling for each strike, where X is the number of attacks. All bonuses 
that would normally apply to a standard attack still apply. (Note: Flash Dance 
can trigger Bulltrue and Preemptive Strike)

== Gun Kata [30 Nanites] ==

Prerequisites:

*  Level 10

Cooldown: X + 1 Rounds
Duration: X Reactions

	Whenever you hit an enemy with a ranged firearm attack, you may use Gun 
Kata to make X additional attacks as Reactions. These attacks must target enemies 
within 15m and within a 45 degree cone centered on the initial target. Each attack 
has a compounding -2 accuracy. (A character making their 3rd strike in a row would 
be rolling at -4 accuracy). A character cannot use more Reactions in a round than 
they have. If you are stunned, unconscious, miss a shot, or your gun runs out of 
rounds, Gun Kata ends.

== Kata [Minimum 5 Nanites] ==
Prerequisites:

*  Level 10

	Whenever you land a successful melee hit against someone, you may roll for X 
additional attacks, where X is your Nanites spent/5. Each additional attack has a 
compounding -2 accuracy. (A 10th level character making their 3rd strike in a 
row would be rolling at -4 accuracy).

== Kip-up [15 Nanites] ==
Prerequisites:

* DEX 6
* STR 5

	A Kip-up is a gymnastic maneuver in which a character lying on the ground
curls up and then kicks up and out into the air, using the resulting momentum to 
jump from their back straight to their feet. This kick does not work well as a
melee attack; the momentum is used to move the kicker rather than to impart 
impact unto a target.

	You may jump up from the prone to the standing position as a Free Action. 
This action cannot be taken to go straight from prone to crouched. Further, if 
the transition from prone to standing to crouched is taken, the normally Free
Action of going from standing to crouched costs an Action. The kip-up cannot be
attempted with Heavy or Full Armor on. The kip-up can only be done once every
three rounds, but doesn't cost any nanites to do. The Three-round cooldown can
be ignored once per round by paying the nanite cost.


== Multi-Target [13*X Nanites] ==
Prerequisites:

*  DEX 6
*  PER 6

	For 2 Actions, concentrate on up to Level+1 number of targets, where X is 
the number of targets. Or concentrate 1 action to target Level/2(round up) 
Targets. You may Roll to-hit your first target in order to determine if you hit 
all of these targets. If you fail the roll, then you may roll again to hit your 
first target normally.

per-action from sprinting. The Miss Chance penalties stack for consecutive uses 
of Run 'N' Gun. 

== Steady Shot [5 Nanites] ==
Prerequisites:

*  PER 7

	Take 1 Action to breath slowly and line up your shot. +1 Ranged accuracy 
and +10m to the weapon's largest range bracket for each level of Steady Shot taken.

rules document). You must be aiming at the target before you can use this feat. 
Maximum 4 levels.
