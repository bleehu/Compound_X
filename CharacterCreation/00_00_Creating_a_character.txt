Creating a Character
==============================

    In Compound X, you control one particular person. This person is your avatar
in the game world. You decide what they say, how they react and what they do
just by telling your Game Master at the appropriate time. But before you can
jump right in and start playing, you need to create a character! This is often
one of the most fun parts of the game!

    Making a character is a slightly involved process that can take a new player 
up to two hours to fully flesh out. There are several parts of characters which
are detailed below, but let's list them here briefly before we get into the 
nitty-gritty of it.

    If you want some extra guidance after reading through the sections below, 
see the 00_New_Player_Walkthrough.txt document in CharacterCreation. Following 
its steps will give you a customized, relatively low-complexity character that 
will help you learn to play the rest of Compound X.

===== Pick a Class =====

    When making a character, you can choose to pick a class first or pick your
species first. Picking your class is usually a simpler decision. See the Classes
Document for the list of available classes and what they can do. 

    Once you've picked a class, you cannot change it later. Some popular Role
Playing Games allow characters to multiclass. The core Compound X Rules does
not support multiclassing at this time.

== Weapon Proficiencies ==

    Each Class comes with a specific list of Weapon Proficiencies. If your 
Character has a proficiency with a type of weapon, then they can use that weapon
in combat and can purchase weapons of that type in the world or during character
creation. If your Character lacks proficiency with a weapon, then they can't 
purchase or use a weapon of that type. 

    Note that Weapon Proficiency is different from having Proficiency with the
Skill Weapon - [X]. For details on Skill Proficiencies and Weapon SKills, see the
"RP/Using Skills" section or the Skills document.

== Armor Proficiencies ==

    Just like each Class comes with a set of Weapon Proficiencies, it also comes
with a list of Armor Proficiencies. Just like Weapon Proficiencies, if your 
class has a Proficiency with a given armor type then they can purchase or wear
that armor type in combat. If your character doesn't have that proficiency, then
they can't.

===== Pick a Species =====

    Check out the Species document for a list of Species and subspecies that
your character could be. Your character must have a species and can only have
one species. 

== Pick a Subspecies ==

    Most Species have a few options of Subspecies. Your character doesn't have
to have a subspecies. They can just be a plain old Human or a stock model 
Security Drone if you want them to.

== Species Traits ==

    Once you've picked your Species and Subspecies, collect the available traits
from both and pick two of them. These are your Species Traits. 

===== Assign Stat Points ======

    Each character in Compound X has different stats. That's how we measure how
good a character is at something, or how lucky they are. You'll use these stats
during puzzles and combat to see how your character performs. 

    Assigning your stats happens in two steps. The first step is making some 
choices about what you want your character's primary stats to be.

    The second step is to do some math to figure out what your modifiers are.
Modifiers are how we make sure that the choices you make about your character
are significant, but you don't have to do the math in the middle of the game.

== Assigning Primary Stats ==

    When making a new character, you'll have to assign their Primary Stats.
This will tell you a lot about your character. Your Species should list how many 
total stat points you have to distribute. When assigning your stats, no stat can 
be higher than a 9 before applying racial/species bonuses and no stat can be 
lower than a 1 after applying racial/species bonuses. 

    Additionally, even after race/species bonuses, feats, equipment, and Primary
Stat bonuses from leveling, no stat can ever be over 15 until your character is 
level 15. After level 15, the limit for stat points is 20. See chapter 1: Races 
if you haven't yet. 

== Assigning Capabilities ==

    Your Capabilities depend on your Primary Stats. Once you have those,
read the section in Basic Rules about Capabilities. Pick how you want them
to go and write them on your sheet.

== Calculating Stat Modifiers ==

    Once you know your Primary stats, it's pretty easy math to find out your 
Stat and Combat Modifiers section in Basic Rules. 

    Your Combat Stat Modifiers are determined by your Primary Stats. There's a
table in the Combat Rules that show what modifier goes with what stat.

+---------+------------+----------+
| P. Stat | Combat Mod | Stat Mod |
+---------+------------+----------+
|    1    |    -1.5    |   -16    |
+---------+------------+----------+
|    2    |     -1     |   -12    |
+---------+------------+----------+
|    3    |    -0.5    |    -8    |
+---------+------------+----------+
|    4    |    -0.5    |    -4    |
+---------+------------+----------+
|    5    |      0     |    0     |
+---------+------------+----------+
|    6    |     0.5    |    4     |
+---------+------------+----------+
|    7    |     0.5    |    8     |
+---------+------------+----------+
|    8    |      1     |    12    |
+---------+------------+----------+
|    9    |      1     |    16    |
+---------+------------+----------+
|   10    |     1.5    |    20    |
+---------+------------+----------+
|   11    |     1.5    |    24    |
+---------+------------+----------+
|   12    |      2     |    28    |
+---------+------------+----------+
|   13    |      2     |    32    |
+---------+------------+----------+
|   14    |     2.5    |    36    |
+---------+------------+----------+
|   15    |      3     |    40    |
+---------+------------+----------+

== Calculating Saving Throws ==

    Now that you've gotten this far, you're ready to write out your Saving 
Throws. 

===== Choosing Skills =====

    Characters gain points in a wide variety of skills to represent their experience
and expertise in different fields and activities. Every time your character levels up,
they gain skill points equal to double your Skill Point Gain. Assign each skill point to
a skill; see CharacterCreation/06_Skills for details about skills and for a list of
commonly-used skills in Compound X. At level 1, your character will have two times their
Skill Point Gain to assign at will. You may gain a maximum of 60 skill points in a single
skill. In addition, each time you level up, you may gain a maximum of 6 points in any one
skill. Skill gained from Feats, Class passives, Species traits and Background bonuses
counts towards the maximum of 60 points per skill, but not towards the maximum skill
increase per level.

===== Buy your gear =====

    Once you have your stats done, you'll know what gear you can carry. So it's
time to get some gear. You can buy your gear in any order you want.

== Buying Weapons ==

    The various weapons documents have lists of weapons and their prices. You
Don't absolutely have to buy a weapon before you go off on an adventure, but
it is highly recommended. Don't forget that your character can't use a weapon
in combat unless they are proficient in that weapon type. Your character's class 
will list what weapons they are proficient with.

== Buying Armor ==

    It might be a good idea to wear armor for your adventure. Look at the Armor
Section of the Combat Rules document and the Armors item document to buy the
right one for your character. Remember that your character can't wear armor that
their class doesn't have proficiency for.

===== Buy Items =====

    As a last step before you take off on your adventure, you might want to
peruse the items document for miscellaneous items that could be helpful on your
trip. 

===== Feats =====

    By now, you're probably thinking that you're done making a character. You're
right! Your character gets feats as they level up. If you really enjoy 
optimising, you can take a look at the feats list and decide what you're going 
to take at later levels. Some of the feats are really cool!
