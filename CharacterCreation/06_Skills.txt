 Skills List
 ==============================
     This document lists all the skills used in Compound_X. Skills augment your
 natural ability. Anyone who is strong enough can kick in a door, but if you
 are specially trained, you can much more effectively accomplish the task.
 
 - GENERAL NOTE: Max of 50 points in any one skill.
 - CHARISMA NOTE: Max of 17 +[CHA]*3 points in Charisma skills.
 
===== CHARISMA =====
Deceive: 
You use your silver tongue to talk your way through situations with 
ease.

Speech: 
The art of outmanuevering your opponent with vocal communication or just being
well understand.
 
===== DEXTERITY =====
Acrobatics: 
Rolling and tumbling come naturally to you. Useful for dodging, 
jumping, balancing, and other fine body-control.

Hand to Hand [Expert]: 
Experts in hand to Hand can perform feats unimaginable 
to mere mortals. They can perform silent take downs, disarmaments, and can 
fight against  edged weapons without a penalty. However, they have to have 
specifically mentioned expert training in their background. Standard mechanics,
or scientists, or farmers will not be able to use this skill. A Buddhist 
Fighting Monk on the other hand, would get this skill for free. Talk to your 
GM. For the most part, anyone can take H-H Expert as a skill, but they must 
take the Melee Combat Expert Feat.

Melee Combat Skill: 
See damage rules under Melee Weapons listing.

Hand-to-Hand/Unarmed Skill:
Trained in unarmed fighting, you are more likely to hit your opponents or block their attacks.

Piloting: 
You have been trained in the use and operation of many vehicles, and 
even if you don’t recognize what it is, you can probably figure out how to use 
it in a couple of turns.

Stealth:
The art of stealth is a blanket over the most cloak and dagger of 
actions. Good thing you’re in on the secret.

Pickpocket: 
Misdirection, priming, and lifting. 

Lockpicking: 
Making physical, mechanical, magnetic, and cryptographic locks go 
from the locked position to the unlocked position without a key. May require 
special equipment.

===== INTELLIGENCE =====
Knowledge [X]: 
You may have gone to college to get a degree in X, or maybe you 
heard all about X from your local reputable information source. Either way, 
you know a lot about X. Options:
	Local
	Criminal
	Nanites
	Sorcery
	Technology
	Alien
	Military

Medicine: 
If health is over 50, DC 30. Any amount over 30 is restored to target's 
health. Rolls under 30 deal d10 bleed damage. If health is under 50, DC 50.
Any amount over 50 is restored to target's health. Rolls under 30 deal d10 
bleed damage. Medicine skill checks can be performed even if untrained in 
medicine, but the user takes a -10%. Medicine packs decrease the DC by 10, 
increase the amount healed by 30, and negate bleed damage on a failed roll.

Navigate: 
you can read a map, congratulations. Any time you are lost, or need 
to decide where to go, this skill will channel your inner survivorman and 
enable you to have a better idea of where you should face.

Hacking: 
Used to gain outside access to computer based systems.

Repair: 
For normal damage (up to 50%) roll percents. Any percent under 50 + 
skill level repairs that much. Rolls over 50 + skill level fail. Target takes 
d10 Shock damage.
For critical damage (50% or less) roll percents. Any percent under 30 + skill 
level repairs that much. Rolls over 30 + skill level fail. Target takes d10 
Shock damage.

Survival: 
Lost in the wilderness? You’re journey home will be made easier by 
your ability to read the terrain, hunt and gather, and erect basic survival 
structures.

Weapons Use (Rifles / Pistols): 
Pertains to clearing jams, assembling a gun, 
reloading, etc. If it has a trigger and a barrel you can figure out how to use 
it.

Weapon Use (Blades): 
Sword care, technique, and use are all covered here. For 
your basic combat knives, long swords, Spears, etc.

Weapon Use (Exotic): 
Not a weapon covered above? it will fall under here. 
Space katanas, Plasma and Coilgun weaponry, and Heavy Weapons need this skill.

===== PERCEPTION =====
Awareness: 
your character's passive perception skill including all 6 senses. This differs from being able to look intently for something particular (Search).

Search: 
Looting things and ransacking offices is something you're quite fond of. Also helps whenever you are looking for something particular, rather than just sweeping the area for something of note (Awareness).

Sniping: 
You have a background going hunting with your dad, or maybe you went 
to marine scout / sniper school. Who cares. If it moves, breathes or thinks, 
you can hit it. Some weapons require this skill for use. 

===== STRENGTH =====
Door Kicking: 
You've been trained in the subtle art of viscously and 
unceremoniously removing a door from it's frame for rapid entry.

Athletics:
Excelling in physical ability, you are a better runner, jumper, climber, and
swimmer than normal.
