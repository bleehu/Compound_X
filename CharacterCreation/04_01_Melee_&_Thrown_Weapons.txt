MELEE WEAPONS & UNARMED FIGHTING
==============================

	These weapons/attacks use an 'Accuracy Modifier' instead of
a 'Miss Chance'. This modifier is added to your combat dex modifier and
and any relevant skill(s) to help you beat your opponent's guard DC.
Melee weapons don't normally pierce armor, unless they state otherwise.

	If you have Hand-to-Hand trained, +10 damage for all melee weapons and 
unarmed fighting. Instead, if you have Hand-to-Hand Expert, +20 damage for all 
melee weapons and unarmed fighting. 

	Also, If you have melee combat skill >=20 then all DEX or STR requirements 
for melee weapons are reduced by 1.

	(When dividing Melee Combat Skill, drop the remainder)

==============================
MISCELLANEOUS THROWN WEAPONS
==============================

	These weapons work similarly to guns. However your range is determined by 
your DEX or STR and your miss chance is reduced by your [Combat PER Mod] + [1 
for every 10 Thrown Weapon Skill]. Like melee attacks, if you roll a Crit or 3+ 
above your Miss Chance, you ignore the target's armor and deal full damage. Misc 
thrown weapons also benefit from Stealth Attacks (see basic rules).

	If you have Hand-to-Hand trained, +10 base damage for all misc thrown 
weapons. Instead, if you have Hand-to-Hand Expert, +20 base damage for all misc 
thrown weapons. 

	Also, If you have melee combat skill >=20 then all DEX or STR requirements 
for Misc. Thrown Weapons are reduced by 1.
