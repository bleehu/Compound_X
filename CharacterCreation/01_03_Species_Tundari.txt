Tundari
==============================

	The cunning and agile Tundari are born predators. The clans of the Tundari
come from their home world of Tundar. They are organic mammals with natural
grace and ferocity. 

===== Appearance/Anatomy =====

	The Tundari are a species of obligate carnivores from the planet Tundaar. 
Physically, they span a wide size range, from the Chi’mau, who can range from 
3’6” to 5’ and 85-130 lbs to the Sang’mau, at 6’ to 7’ and up to 400 lbs, and 
every size in-between. Like humans, Tundari have many different body types.

	A sleek coat of fur covers these people, ranging widely in color and pattern. 
It tends to grow short and fine over the majority of the body, however, the face, 
head, neck, and joints have been known to grow hair that is longer and coarser, 
with a mane or scruff-like quality about it.

	As a carnivorous species, they have large, forward-facing, wide-set eyes, clawed 
limbs, and large, sharp teeth. Their ears sprout from closer to the top of their 
heads than the sides, and can be triangular or round. 
	
	They are considered a hardy species, but have not adapted well to fight off 
poisons or foreign contaminants. They are diurnal, and have low-light vision, 
but can also see well in daylight. 

Types:
* Biological
* Mammalian
* Warm-blooded 
* Carnivorous 

===== Society =====

	As many cultures mark themselves with tattoos, the Tundari also have their 
own method of skin-marking. Some outliers will dye their fur, but that is 
generally frowned upon by the traditionalists of Tundari society. The traditional 
method of marking is called Aranga, though many ranchers will would recognize 
the method as very similar to the freeze-branding livestock is marked with. 
Aranga, however, is far more intricate that simple freeze-branding.

	Culturally and economically, the clans on the Tundari homeworld have an 
instated breeding season once every four years. Cubs born outside of this season 
are not harmed, but their parents are firmly reprimanded for the first, and 
drastic measures may be taken if a single family has multiple children outside 
of the typical breeding times. Rather than the recent byproduct of a controlling 
government, these mandates came into effect nearly four-hundred years prior. As 
infant mortality rates decreased, the population increased far more rapidly than 
their ecosystem could support. They have kept their population stable for the 
last three centuries out of necessity, and no one seems inclined to change their ways.
Space exploration and colonization have begun to change their adherence to the breeding
season tradition, but many colonists still ascribe to the old mandates.


===== Language: Tuunra ===== 

	While different clans have their own unique dialects, they are similar enough that 
they can be understood by all. Tuunra features drawn-out vowels, soft consonants, and 
sounds such as clicks, chirps, trills, and a low rumbling that is nearly inaudible 
to humans. There is another integral part of Tuunra that many species do not pick up
on, and that is an intricate system of body language that involves both tail and ears.
A Tundari that has lost their tail may have great difficulty communicating with others of
their species.

	Tundari can communicate basic ideas and general instructions noiselessly. 

===== Names ===== 

	Names in Tuunra are important; they not only designate clan, but to some degree, 
that clan's social status. More recently, many of these meanings have been obscured or 
become obsolete. Despite this, others have stuck around and remain titles that can be lost 
or gained.
	Titles may be given to individuals, clans as a whole, or part of a clan may branch 
off to be designated with a seperate title. For instance, the Chi clan were primarily fishers
of the Merkhe river, giving them the title of 'Mer; when a small portion of the clan moved to
the practice of what Terrans call aquaponics, that branch gained the new title of 'Krou.

	Notable Titles:
	'Mau is an indication of a clan's status. It is generally bestowed upon large or 
influential clans that make a large impact on their society as a whole.
	'Khe is a term given to an individual rather than a clan. It is a degredation 
indicating exile or disgrace. Unless the individual abides strictly by Tundari social rules,
they may not introduce themselves as such to outsiders, as it is often a source of shame.
	'Mer generally refers to those clans who gain their living or live on the Merkhe river, a 
large body of water that flows down the through the continent of Senrima.
	'Krou is a combination of the Tuunra words kyr (fish) and rou'en (medicinal herbs). It 
was taken by those who took up aquaponics to raise both fish for consumption and herbs. While
these herbs are traditionally medicinal, a group with this title may focus on other herbs, feed
for livestock, or other useful organic materials. 
	'En is a title given to healers and doctors trained on Tundaar. 

	First names range very much as humans, as far as origin. While often having some significance 
to the family, first names are fairly arbitrary in much of Tundari society. Tribe and 
clan names are held the most important, and as such, are always listed first.
Some Tundari have been exiled, lost their clan names, or adopted their own. Others have 
adopted names from the other cultures they now live with.

===== Passives =====

Weakness to Poisons/Contagions:
	Your Saving Throws to avoid being infected by a poison or afflicted by a contagion are 
rolled with Disadvantage. This applies only to initial rolls for a particular toxin, not 
subsequent rolls regarding complications or recovery.

===== Available Traits =====

Clawed:
	Already equipped with built-in weapons, you are practiced at using the large claws
on your forelimbs to give you an advantage in hand-to-hand combat. 
[Whenever you damage an enemy's health with Unarmed Strike, if that enemy does not have a Bleed token, they gain 1 Bleed token.]

Soft-footed:
	An ambush predator, you are built for sneaking up on those around you. You know how to 
handle your weight and use the knowledge passed down by generations of hunters to keep 
your presence a secret.
[You may Roll the Average on any Stealth check.]

Prehensile Tail: 
	You have spent a long time using your tail to do more than just communicate. 
You can grab onto items, use it to aid in climbing, or even hang from it. It's
fuzzy and doesn't have any fingers on it, so you can't use it to do everything
you could do with your hands. While strong enough to lift a weapon, your tail
isn't strong enough to aim steadily and certainly couldn't lift a person on its
own.
	You may roll advantage on Acrobatics (DEX) checks and reload checks by using
your extra limb to help. Once per encounter per enemy you may roll advantage on
a combat maneuver. This comes from using your tail to trip, push, block, etc 
against an enemy.

Toothed: 
	As a predatory species, you have the customary long teeth that frighten many. 
To you, they are commonplace, but to many others, they induce a primal fear of being
hunted and eaten. 
[Gain Advantage on initial Intimidation checks toward and against other Biological
beings.]

==============================
Tundari Clans
==============================

===== Rra’mau =====

Size: Medium/Large
Favored Terrain: Plains

Appearance: 
	This clan tends to have coats that range from tawny to sorrel. They are 
leaner than the Sang’mau, as a whole.

Tribe: 
	The most social of all the clans, Rra’mau is the face for intergalactic trade,
policies, and general hospitality to outsiders. The clans all meet together to 
decide these policies beforehand, (usually) for the betterment of the species; Rra’mau
figure-head the process to outsiders.

== Available Traits ==

Hind-Claws:
	Digging into the ground with the large claws present on your hind-limbs spurs your 
ability to run much faster than your peers. 
[To calculate your Movement Speed per action, use (Movement Speed)/2 and round up to the
nearest integer.]


Wide-faced:
	Many species seem to be drawn to your large eyes. You aren’t certain why, but it gives 
you an advantage when attempting to persuade or charm members of other biological species. 
[Once per biological individual, you may roll a Persuation check with Advantage.]



===== Sang’mau =====

Size: Large
Favored Terrain: Forest/Jungle

Appearance: 
	Coats range from black, to tawny, to brighter colors such as orange and red. 
These Tundari are larger, more powerful hunters than their cousins, relying more on brute 
strength and ambushing than on speed. While the trees on Tundaar well supported the weight 
of these people, it is hard to find natural equivalents on other planets.

Tribe: 
	Another very social clan, the Sang’mau were deemed too frightening to be the best 
negotiators after first contact with the Terrans, when the visiting diplomat fainted at 
the mere sight. While more commonplace now, this clan tends to stay out of the direct
Terran-Tundari diplomacy. Sang'mau often focus their social tendencies on protecting and
governing the more insular parts of Tundari society.

== Available Traits ==

Climbing: 
	A long tail and a lack of fear for heights allows climbing to come very naturally to you. 
[Gain Advantage on Athletics (STR) Checks when Climbing]

Powerful: 
	Large, developed muscles allow you to carry more and hit harder. 
[Increase your Carry Ability by 2, and increase the damage of your Unarmed Strike by 5. At levels 5, 9, 15, and 20, further increase the damage of your Unarmed Strike by 5.]



===== Chi’mau =====

Size: Small
Favored Terrain: Urban/Rocky

Appearance: 
	Coats range from a red-tawny to grey and black. These Tundari are the smallest 
in both size and number of the large clans. 

Tribe:
	In contrast to the two other largest clans, the Chi'mau focus more on the nuclear
family than on a larger society as a whole. This is likely more due to geography than 
an inclination to keep to themselves. They traditionally live in mountainous river valleys 
with steep cliff walls and fish is their main source of sustenance. The idea that each
family has a larger territory has stuck through several centuries of innovation and urbanization.
Even outside their traditionally remote territories, Chi'mau usually prefer small, highly
private social circles.


== Available Traits ==

Survivalist: 
	Being out by yourself often requires quick ingenuity and hardiness. 
[Gain Proficiency in Jury-Rigging]

Swimmer: 
	You are an expert at swimming. A thick coat of fur protects you from the chill of 
the water, and you can hold your breath for quite some time.
[Gain Advantage on rolls related to Swimming. Can hold breath up to 5 minutes]
