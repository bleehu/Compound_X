==============================
Skills
==============================
	Each character learns things while going through life. Maybe your time in
the military taught you how to navigate using the stars or maybe your time working
at a mechanic's shop made you good at repairing things? Or maybe you're one of
those people who is just naturally good at hacking computers.

	Whenever you roll to see if your character succeeds in a task they have 
skill in, add both your character's points in relevant skills and the relevant
stat modifier. Ask your GM to confirm what skills and stats apply to the roll.

===== Gaining Skill Points and Skill Proficiency =====
	Each time a character levels up, they gain a certain number of skill
points to distribute as they choose. Total skill point gain per level is based on 
a character's intelligence or charisma, as described in Basic Rules. However, a 
character may only gain up to 5 points in a skill per level, up to a maximum of 60. 
Some feats, backgrounds and class passives will give a character points in a 
specific skill. While these skill gains are not subjected to the limit on skill 
point gain per level, they do contribute to the maximum of 60 points in a skill. 
For example, when a Pilot gains 10 skill in a Vehicles: Flight as a class passive 
at level 1, the pilot can still gain 5 points in Vehicles: Flight by spending skill
points they earn by leveling up from level 0.

	Characters are considered to be Proficient with certain skills, based on
their class and background. When a character is Proficient in a skill, each skill 
point they spend in that skill upon leveling up increases that skill by two 
instead of one.

===== Skill Checks and Critical Successes =====
	If you roll a critical success on a skill check, add 10 to your total roll.
For an extra critical, add 20.

===== "General" Skills =====
	Some skill groups such as Knowledge, Weapons, and Vehicles allow
characters to learn the skill both in general and in specific cases. If the
character does not know the specific skill in a group that applies to a situation,
the player can instead add half of the character's general skill in that skill
group (rounded down). For example, if a GM asks for a roll in Knowledge: History,
but the character only has 10 skill in Knowledge: General, the player can add 5
from Knowledge: General to the Knowledge: History roll. However, if the  GM asks
for a roll in Knowledge: General, the player can add all 10 points from
Knowledge: General to the roll.

===== Skills in Compound X =====
	This list of some of the most commonly-used skills in Compound X is
arranged based on the stats that are usually associated with the skill. Your GM
may decide that a different stat applies to any given instance. In addition,
this is not an exhaustive list of skills, merely the skills called for most
often. Talk to your GM if you would like your character to learn a more specific
