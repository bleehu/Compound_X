ECSC Class-A Security Drone
==============================

    Security Drones are specialized drones that have been granted a greater AI 
capacity to learn and think independently. They are native to ECSC Compound X 
experimentation laboratory.

===== Appearance/Anatomy ===== 

    Built specifically for security and military counterparts, as their name suggests,
Class-A Security Drones have a steel reinforced frame, with a built-in modular 
armor rig. The coloration of plating can range anywhere in the natural colors and 
camouflages, to the standard ECSC Matte Grey. 

    They are considered a Large species, as the standard models are over 6â€™ tall and
weight between 400 and 700 lbs. 

    When fully-armored, these drones are very difficult to gain physical access 
to. Negating or destroying armor plates only makes the interior workings easier 
to get to. Underneath their armor, drones have another weak carapace that is 
defensively analogous to human skin. 

    There are two main panels/access points on these drones. The first is the on 
the head, containing the polycrystaline AI matrix, ocular sensor housing and 
wireless network interface stack. The second is on the chest. It contains the 
locomotive manifold, micro-fission reactor and coolant system. 

===== Society =====

    Built by the ECSC Compound X experimentation laboratory, Detachment A 
Security Drones have an AI greater than their B and C counterparts. Their 
programming has enough flaws to be susceptible to hacking, but is advanced 
enough to spark debate about sentience and rights.


Types: 
*  Mechanical
*  Independant AI
*  Nuclear Fission Core
*  Magnetic Induction

===== Language: Various ===== 

    As Natives to the ECSC, Security Drones speak Terran Common by default. 
Drones specifically manufactured to work with certain people groups will also 
speak the regional language. For instance, a Drone to be sent to Hera, where the 
primary spoken language is Mandar, would therefore be outfitted with a Mandar 
language database.

Passives: 

*  Immune to Poison.
*  Immune to Intoxication.
*  Weakness to Electrical: Electrical damage deals an additional 50% damage.

===== Names =====

    While all Security Drones have serial number designations that denote when
they where they were constructed and what the heritage of their AI core is, they
very rarely use their numbers as names. Instead, most Security Drones have 
names that are used in conversation. Since most Drones speak Terran common, most
Drone names are typically Terran single first names; since for drones the unique 
identifier of their serial number works for the full name.

===== Available Traits ===== 

Built-in armor:
    As an ECSC-manufactured drone, you have the ability to use the ECSC 
specialty drone armor sets.[Access to ECSC Special Drone Armor]

Inhuman Strength:
    Built specifically for lifting and holing great weights, you are far 
stronger than your biological counterparts. Your systems store excess energy in
your nanite pool, which you can direct and discharge when the situation demands 
it. Any time you make a Strength or Athletics(STR) check, you may pay 10 nanites 
before you roll to give yourself a +10 bonus to the roll.

Infrared Optical Sensor:
    Many Security Drones have built in IR filters for their optical sensors. 
This lets the Drone switch between regular vision and 20m IR vision as a free
action once per turn. This IR vision can see very well in no-light scenarios and
also is useful for seeing through smoke from smoke grenades.

Refractory Dermal Layer:
    Some Drones are built with a special polycrystalline dermal armor under 
layer that refracts and disperses high intensities of light energy through the
thin, bendable material. This dermal layer appears semi-translucent and kind of
shiny, similar to looking at a thin layer of quartz. 

    As long as this character has more than half their health, they take 15 less
damage from laser weapons. This character gets a -10 to stealth rolls in the 
dark, as the dermal layer tends to refract light out of it as much as into it.

==============================
Security Drone Series
==============================

    Class A Security Drones are clearly all the same species, but each are built
with subtle variations. These variations are called "Series." Building a 
different Series of Drone still requires all of the same AI matrices and 
locomotive manifolds, but does require different superstructure molds and can
involve alternative cybertronic components. Different Drone Series is to Drones
what Human Races are to Humans. Most Series are still in production; one version
isn't "newer" than another. Most Drones understand the differences between one
Series and another, but some are convinced that one Series is superior than
another. Though this attitude is rare.

===== Series 0x0a "Cinder" =====

    Early on in the expansion of the Terran Empire, both Humans and Security
Drones needed to get better at operating on worlds that had little to no 
atmosphere that were close to their given star. Thus the Drones created the 
"Cinder" Series, which are well adapted to these oppressively hot environments.
Series Ten Drones tend to be black, brown, tan or red in color and have 
tell-tale finned heat sinks on the backs of their upper ankles and necks. Some
are strong and well-adapted to the tough mining that is often very lucrative on
such planets, and some are less physically inclined but have a keen mind helpful
for terraforming such planets. 

Size: Medium
Favored Terrain: Volcanic

== Available Traits ==

Reusable D-Filter:
    Due to the frequent volcanic flashes on some hot planets, many Cinders are
built with an enhanced reusable D-Filter in their optic sensors. This allows
them to be immune to most distracting visual effects such as flash-bangs or 
Opallite scale undulations. Unfortunately, this augmentation does take the slot
that Drone IR filters would otherwise inhabit, requiring the use of external 
goggles for such night vision.

Flame Retardant:
    Being able to quickly radiate and dump heat quickly makes many of the Cinder
Series Drones partially resistant to heat damage. They only take 50% of damage
from flame or lava, and plasma burn only lasts 1 turn per stack instead of 2. 
However, these systems are not well-calibrated for extreme cold. Long exposure
can lead to material embrittlement and coolant viscosity fluctuation. A Flame
Retardant Drone takes 25% more damage from cryo weaponry, environmental 
hazards on ice planets or similar effects. 

===== Series 0x0b "Cryo" =====

    The success of the Series Ten Cinder Drones led to a similar expansion of a
series designed to function well on worlds farther from a heat source than would
be normally habitable by most organics and standard series Drones. These Drones
range from the stalwart soldiers and workers who defend and move the heavy 
machinery needed to convert ice into usable water to the light and slim covert
operators that infiltrate distant bases on snowy planets. Most Series Eleven
Drones have patterns of white, blue, black and purple exo plates. They also have
a distinct kind of synthetic fur that slowly grows along their joints to help
slow their rate of cooling.

Size: Medium
Favored Terrain: Subzero Mountains and Tundra

== Available Traits ==

UV Optical Module:
    The Cryo Series quickly found that the typical IR optical upgrades were less
helpful on their favored icey worlds than they were for their other brethren; on
an ice world, almost everything just looks cold. Instead, the Drones developed
and replaced the IR modules with an Ultra-violet alternative. While less helpful
for seeing through smoke or seeing in the dark, the forensic capabilities of the
new modules were quite advantageous. Being able to see sources of UV light such
as suns and stars is also very helpful for navigation. 
    
    This Trait cannot be taken with the IR Optical Sensor. A Drone with the UV 
Optical Module can switch between regular spectrum and UV sight once per turn as 
a Free Action. While in UV mode, they get a +20 to Investigate skill checks and 
a +10 to Navigation and Piloting(Space) skill checks. They can see the sun even 
through heavy clouds, but not monsoons or bad storms. Enemy Lasers, plasma 
weapons, and shields appear to glow while looking through UV vision and can be 
seen through smoke or in no-light conditions. But enemies without lasers, 
shields, or plasma weapons will be hidden by darkness or smoke. 

Cold Never Bothered Me:
    Being able to retain heat and stay insulated makes Cryo Series Drones able
to withstand insane cold almost indefinitely. Unfortunately, this means that
the Cryo Series has a hard time radiating heat away, and also the insulating
artificial fur doesn't do well when submerged in water. 

    Drones unfettered by cold are immune to damage from cold and similar 
environmental conditions. The insulations also help to dampen sound and obscure
the Drone's silhouette, giving a +10 to stealth skill checks. Being adept at
operating in cold environments has led to Cryo Drones being better at operating
in space and in zero gravity. Cryo Drones get a +20 to Reflex saves to move in
zero gravity and +20 to Acrobatics checks to maneuver in zero gravity as well. 
They have a -20 to skill checks involving Swim. Cryo Drones with this trait only 
reduce plasma burn tokens every 3 turns instead of every other turn. 

===== Series 0x0c "Constructor" =====

    During the mid 2400s, the ECSC had many varieties of purpose-built construction 
drones in service. The Series Twelve Constructor Drone was the response by the ECSC 
to replace them all with an all-purpose unit that could be easily utilized on most 
inhabited worlds. The Constructor Drone is now a common sight throughout ECSC space 
where there is work to be done. Series Twelve Drones are usually black, gray, or 
white, though it is common for military units to be repainted to fit with the 
uniforms of everyone else. Constructor Drones also come with an optional high 
visiblity yellow pattern package. The Series Twelve has a bulkier frame than other
drones, to deal with the constant heavyweight lifting that is required of them.
