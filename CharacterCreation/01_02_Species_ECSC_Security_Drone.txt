==============================
ECSC Class-A Security Drone
==============================

    Security Drones are specialized drones that have been granted a greater AI 
capacity to learn and think independently. They are native to ECSC Compound X 
experimentation laboratory.

===== Appearance/Anatomy ===== 

    Built specifically for security and military counterparts, as their name suggests,
Class-A Security Drones have a steel reinforced frame, with a built-in modular 
armor rig. The coloration of plating can range anywhere in the natural colors and 
camouflages, to the standard ECSC Matte Grey. 

    They are considered a Large species, as the standard models are over 6’ tall and
weight between 400 and 700 lbs. 

    When fully-armored, these drones are very difficult to gain physical access 
to. Negating or destroying armor plates only makes the interior workings easier 
to get to. Underneath their armor, drones have another weak carapace that is 
defensively analogous to human skin. 

    There are two main panels/access points on these drones. The first is the on 
the head, containing the polycrystaline AI matrix, ocular sensor housing and 
wireless network interface stack. The second is on the chest. It contains the 
locomotive manifold, micro-fission reactor and coolant system. 

===== Society =====

    Built by the ECSC Compound X experimentation laboratory, Detachment A 
Security Drones have an AI greater than their B and C counterparts. Their 
programming has enough flaws to be susceptible to hacking, but is advanced 
enough to spark debate bout sentience and rights.


Types: 
*  Mechanical
*  Independant AI
*  Nuclear Fission Core
*  Magnetic Induction

===== Language: Various ===== 

    As Natives to the ECSC, Security Drones speak Terran Common by default. 
Drones specifically manufactured to work with certain people groups will also 
speak the regional language. For instance, a Drone to be sent to Hera, where the 
primary spoken language is Mandar, would therefore be outfitted with a Mandar 
language database.

Passives: 

*  Immune to Poison.
*  Immune to Intoxication.
*  Weakness to Electrical: Electrical damage deals an additional 50% damage.

===== Names =====

    While all Security Drones have serial number designations that denote when
they where they were constructed and what the heritage of their AI core is, they
very rarely use their numbers as names. Instead, most Security Drones have 
names that are used in conversation. Since most Drones speak Terran common, most
Drone names are typically Terran single first names; since for drones the unique 
identifier of their serial number works for the full name.

===== Available Traits ===== 

Built-in armor:
    As an ECSC-manufactured drone, you have the ability to use the ECSC 
specialty drone armor sets.[Access to ECSC Special Drone Armor]

Inhuman Strength:
    Built specifically for lifting and holing great weights, you are far 
stronger than your biological counterparts. Your systems store excess energy in
your nanite pool, which you can direct and discharge when the situation demands 
it. Any time you make a Strength or Athletics(STR) check, you may pay 10 nanites 
before you roll to give yourself a +10 bonus to the roll.

Infrared Optical Sensor:
    Many Security Drones have built in IR filters for their optical sensors. 
This lets the Drone switch between regular vision and 20m IR vision as a free
action once per turn. This IR vision can see very well in no-light scenarios and
also is useful for seeing through smoke from smoke grenades.

Refractory Dermal Layer:
    Some Drones are built with a special polycrystalline dermal armor under 
layer that refracts and disperses high intensities of light energy through the
thin, bendable material. This dermal layer appears semi-translucent and kind of
shiny, similar to looking at a thin layer of quartz. 

    As long as this character has more than half their health, they take 15 less
damage from laser weapons. This character gets a -10 to stealth rolls in the 
dark, as the dermal layer tends to refract light out of it as much as into it.
