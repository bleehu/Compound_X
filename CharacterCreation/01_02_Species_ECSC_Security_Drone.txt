ECSC Class-A Security Drone
==============================

    Security Drones are specialized drones that have been granted a greater AI 
capacity to learn and think independently. They are native to ECSC Compound X 
experimentation laboratory.

===== Appearance/Anatomy ===== 

    Built specifically for security and military counterparts, as their name suggests,
Class-A Security Drones have a steel reinforced frame, with a built-in modular 
armor rig. The coloration of plating can range anywhere in the natural colors and 
camouflages, to the standard ECSC Matte Grey. 

    They are considered a Large species, as the standard models are over 6’ tall and
weight between 400 and 700 lbs. 

    When fully-armored, these drones are very difficult to gain physical access 
to. Negating or destroying armor plates only makes the interior workings easier 
to get to. Underneath their armor, drones have another weak carapace that is 
defensively analogous to human skin. 

    There are two main panels/access points on these drones. The first is the on 
the head, containing the polycrystaline AI matrix, ocular sensor housing and 
wireless network interface stack. The second is on the chest. It contains the 
locomotive manifold, micro-fission reactor and coolant system. 

===== Society =====

    Built by the ECSC Compound X experimentation laboratory, Detachment A 
Security Drones have an AI greater than their B and C counterparts. Their 
programming has enough flaws to be susceptible to hacking, but is advanced 
enough to spark debate bout sentience and rights.


Types: 
*  Mechanical
*  Independant AI
*  Nuclear Fission Core
*  Magnetic Induction

===== Language: Various ===== 

    As Natives to the ECSC, Security Drones speak Terran Common by default. 
Drones specifically manufactured to work with certain people groups will also 
speak the regional language. For instance, a Drone to be sent to Hera, where the 
primary spoken language is Mandar, would therefore be outfitted with a Mandar 
language database.

Passives: 

*  Immune to Poison.
*  Immune to Intoxication.
*  Weakness to Electrical: Electrical damage deals an additional 50% damage.

===== Available Traits ===== 

Built-in armor:
    As an ECSC-manufactured drone, you have the ability to use the ECSC 
specialty drone armor sets.[Access to ECSC Special Drone Armor]

Inhuman Strength:
    Built specifically for lifting and holing great weights, you are far 
stronger than your biological counterparts. Your systems store excess energy in
your nanite pool, which you can direct and discharge when the situation demands 
it. Any time you make a Strength or Athletics(STR) check, you may pay 10 nanites 
before you roll to give yourself a +10 bonus to the roll.
    
Refractory Dermal Layer:
    Some Drones are built with a special polycrystalline dermal armor under 
layer that refracts and disperses high intensities of light energy through the
thin, bendable material. This dermal layer appears semi-translucent and kind of
shiny, similar to looking at a thin layer of quartz. 

    As long as this character has more than half their health, they take 15 less
damage from laser weapons. This character gets a -10 to stealth rolls in the 
dark, as the dermal layer tends to refract light out of it as much as into it.

==============================
Security Drone Series
==============================

    Class A Security Drones are clearly all the same species, but each are built
with subtle variations. These variations are called "Series." Building a 
different Series of Drone still requires all of the same AI matrices and 
locomotive manifolds, but does require different superstructure molds and can
involve alternative cybertronic components. Different Drone Series is to Drones
what Human Races are to Humans. Most Series are still in production; one version
isn't "newer" than another. Most Drones understand the differences between one
Series and another, but some are convinced that one Series is superior than
another. Though this attitude is rare.

===== Series 0x0a "Cinder" =====

    Early on in the expansion of the Terran Empire, both Humans and Security
Drones needed to get better at operating on worlds that had little to no 
atmosphere that were close to their given star. Thus the Drones created the 
"Cinder" Series, which are well adapted to these oppressively hot environments.
Series Ten Drones tend to be black, brown, tan or red in color and have 
tell-tale finned heat sinks on the backs of their upper ankles and necks. Some
are strong and well-adapted to the tough mining that is often very lucrative on
such planets, and some are less physically inclined but have a keen mind helpful
for terraforming such planets. 

Size: Medium
Favored Terrain: Volcanic

== Available Traits ==

Reusable D-Filter:
    Due to the frequent volcanic flashes on some hot planets, many Cinders are
built with an enhanced reusable D-Filter in their optic sensors. This allows
them to be immune to most distracting visual effects such as flash-bangs or 
Opallite scale undulations. Unfortunately, this augmentation does take the slot
that Drone IR filters would otherwise inhabit, requiring the use of external 
goggles for such night vision.

Flame Retardant:
    Being able to quickly radiate and dump heat quickly makes many of the Cinder
Series Drones partially resistant to heat damage. They only take 50% of damage
from flame or lava, and plasma burn only lasts 1 turn per stack instead of 2. 
However, these systems are not well-calibrated for extreme cold. Long exposure
can lead to material embrittlement and coolant viscosity fluctuation. A Flame
Retardant Drone takes 25% more damage from cryo weaponry, environmental 
hazards on ice planets or similar effects.
