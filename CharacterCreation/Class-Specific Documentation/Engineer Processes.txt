==============================
Repair Tree
==============================
Network Motes: 
    Any repair process that an engineer uses on a cybernetic ally
(even if that process doesn't specify that it can only be used on cybernetic
allies) leaves a "network mote" on that ally. When calculating roaming range
of drones built in the build tree, the range of the drone is taken from the
nearest network mote or the engineer that deployed it.

    Unlocking a Repair tree skill requires having unlocked the skill below it on 
the tree. Please see the Engineer Skill Tree - Repair.png for dependencies.

===== Cyberphysical =====

== Reboot	== 
Nanite Gain:65
Action:		1 Action
Duration: 	N/A
Range:		Touch

    Only usable on cybernetic allies that are "bleeding" out. That ally
is now stable and has 30 hp, rather than having to stabilize the target and 
then heal them. Not a quiet procedure; detectable within 40m by a perception 
check of 30.

== Data Scrub	== 
Nanite Gain:35
Action:		1 Action
Duration: 	N/A
Range:		Touch

    Only usable on cybernetic allies who have been hacked or dominated.
The engineer makes a repair check opposed by half of the hacker's hack check or
dominator's sorcery check. If the engineer wins, the ally or system is scrubbed
and the system control returns to normal. The engineer only receives Nanites 
for successful scrubs. Be aware that engineers are not the only class that can
scrub a hacked target.

== Restore Armor	== 
Nanite Gain:50
Action: 	2 Actions
Duration:	Almost Instant
Range: 		Touch

    You tinker with your ally's armor and mend it. Undo any Debuffs on
your ally's armor such as sundering, battle damage, etc. 

== Percussive Maintenance	== 
Nanite Gain:30
Action:		1 Action
Duration:	Almost Instant
Range:		Touch

    This stupid thing is broken again! You hit it with your wrench and
deal 10 damage to it. Roll luck modifier, with a DC of 1.5 x target's total 
damage after wrench hit. Add to that DC 10 for each minor status effect and
15 for each major status effect, at the GM's discretion. If The DC is passed,
Fix all minor status effects, one major status effect, or heal one wound. This
process may only be performed on cybernetic allies, turrets, vehicles or as
an RP event. Not to be confused with the concussive maintenance feat.

== Defrag	== 
Nanite Gain:15
Action:		1 Action
Duration:	Until First Use
Range:		Touch

    You auto-balance your cybernetic ally's priority queues, defrag
their memory and basically perform typical maintenance. Feeling refreshed,
your ally continues on their way. Your ally gets a +5% bonus to their next
RP roll.

== Actuator Overdrive	== 
Nanite Gain:20
Action:		1 Action
Duration: 	engagement
Range:		Touch

    For an engagement, an ally moves 3m per action more. Ally 
movement has an absolute cap of 14m per action, even if some other effect
would make it higher. A player may not be overdrived/overclocked more than 
once per engagement. Only works on cybernetic allies.

== Discrete Overclock	== 
Nanite Gain:20
Action:		1 Action
Duration: 	Engagement
Range:		Touch

    A cybernetic ally gets a -8% to miss for the duration of the 
engagement. They also get a +15 to reloading weapons quickly and a +10 to 
perception checks. 

== Network Targeting	== 
Nanite Gain:20
Action:		1 Action
Duration:	Until First Use
Range:		Touch

    You interface a visual triangulation unit with your cybernetic 
ally's visual sensors. It cross-references targets with other friendly 
machine's sensors to deliver a more complete image of the target. Your
cybernetic ally gets a -3% to miss their next target for each friendly
drone, robot and turret that is also looking at that target. This effect
may be blocked with a hacking attack at DC 20. 

== System Overclock	== 
Nanite Gain:35
Action:		1 Action
Duration: 	Engagement
Range:		Touch

    A cybernetic ally gets a -14% to miss for the duration of the engagement.
They also get a +35 to reloading weapons quickly and a +10 to perception checks, but
take 20 damage from system overheat.

== Colocation Processing	== 
Nanite Gain:20
Action:		1 Action
Duration:	Until First Use
Range:		6m

    You use your onboard manufacturing system processor as a dedicated
server to help process your cybernetic ally's analytic data. The next time that
ally makes a lockpick, hacking, explosives, repair, heal, or tracking check, 
they get a +15 to it. 

== Regression Override	== 
Nanite Gain:60
Action:		1 Action
Duration:	8 Turns
Range:		Touch

    You temporarily disable your cybernetic ally's regression system,
the part of their personality program that slows down to triple check the 
results of their actions. This sends them into a rage mode. They still know
friend from foe, and they still have a jenky understanding of their higher-
order skills like lockpicking, hacking, or social finesse, but they have no
fear, no pain, no remorse and no hesitation for about half of a minute. Your
ally Cannot feel shock during this duration, and cannot be repaired (they
won't stand still). They get a bonus +15% to accuracy nearer than 41m. They
also deal an extra 20 damage with melee or fire an extra bullet with rapid-
fire weapons. They take a penalty of 25% to skill checks, including acrobat or
parkour checks (these take regression to calculate). An ally affected by 
Regression Override may use a strength +2 bonus at any time, but each time they
do, they take 20 damage of wear and tear. An engineer can only perform a 
regression override once per encounter. Regression Overrides do not stack.

== System Restore	== 
Nanite Gain:35
Action:		2 Actions
Duration: 	Permanent
Range:		Touch

    Can only be used on a cybernetic subject who's primary data center 
is still intact that has "bled out" less than 8 turns ago. The Engineer makes 
a DC 60 repair check. If successful, the subject is now "bleeding out". If the
subject is saved, they get the feat "Refurbished". Characters with the 
"Refurbished" feat have a permanent -1 to Intelligence and can never again be
revived with System Restore.

===== Material/Mechanic =====

== Duct Tape	== 
Nanite Gain:40
Action:		1 Action
Duration: 	N/A
Range:		Touch

    Ok, there was a little more to it than that. One of your targets 
wounds are healed. This trick only works on cybernetic allies. This also works
on non-sentient robots and machinery.

== Weapon Tuning	== 
Nanite Gain:20
Action:		1 Action
Duration: 	engagement
Range:		Touch

    You fiddle with your ally's gun quickly. You tune the whosits, and
dial the whatsits. It now has a -5% chance to miss and has half the chance of
jamming. Normal use and wear on the gun will almost definitely unalign what 
you've done by the end of the engagement, but hopefully your efforts will help 
keep your ally alive until then.

== Vehicle Repair	== 
Nanite Gain:40
Action:		4 Actions
Duration:	almost instant
Range:		Touch

    You pull out your tools and quickly repair the damage to a friendly
vehicle. It gains 1 vehicle health. While this power is not required to repair
vehicles, it does add a Nanite reward for doing so. It also increases the 
effect and may reduce the time taken to repair. 

== Multisys Repair	== 
Nanite Gain:30*n
Action:		1 Action
Duration: 	N/A
Range:		Touch

    The automaton is healed by the Engineer's heal roll / n, where n is 
the number of wounds that the automaton has. This trick only works on cybernetic 
beings or machines.

== Micro Assembler	== 
Nanite Gain:50
Action:		1 Action
Duration: 	8 turns
Range:		Touch

    You release a spider-like micro repair bot that repairs a cybernetic
ally for 8 turns before running out of power. The microbot is able to heal
15 health per turn. The microbot burns up in CS burn. A Microassembler uses
wireless cloud calculation to stay small, but on-blueprint. As such, it is
vulnerable to hack checks at a DC of 50. A hacked micro assembler reveals its
location and may deal 5 damage per turn.

== Engine Tuning	== 
Nanite Gain:50
Action:		6 Actions
Duration: 	Almost Instant
Range:		Touch

    You crack open the hood of whatever vehicle is around and begin to
clean the spark plug, dial in the cylinder timing and add your own special
sauce to the engine's fuel injector. It will now run at 125% power, and it has
full health. Effect may vary by RP. See GM for details. While this power is not
required to boost the effect of a vehicle, it now rewards you in Nanites for
doing so and increases your effectiveness at doing so.

== Boilerplate Handiwork	== 
Nanite Gain:20
Action:		1 Action
Duration: 	Permanent
Range:		Touch

    Just slam some more metal on there! You add a protective layer to
one of your cybernetic allies. This adds 40 to their health, but slows them
down by 1m per action. This effect lasts until that 40 health has been 
destroyed, or until the engineer takes it off and discards it.

== Zero Friction Covalent	== 
Nanite Gain:20
Action:		1 Action
Duration: 	Until next melee hit
Range:		Touch

    You coat your ally's weapon with a friction-negating substance that
binds with the blade on the molecular level, which makes it easier to slice 
through targets. Add one to the weapon's damage multiplier. The substance isn't
very durable and is difficult to handle, so an engineer can't use it on their
own weapon and the effect only lasts until the next hit. Cannot be used on a 
weapon more than once at a time.

== Sup it Up	== 
Nanite Gain:80
Action:		12 Actions
Duration: 	8 turns
Range:		Touch

    Target friendly vehicle has full health, and its engine runs at
maximum efficiency. Full effect is up to Role Playing and GM. Additions
include but are not limited to:
adding a NOS tank
adding a 1-vehicle damage shield
adding stabilized chassis for improved accuracy when fired from 

== Ceramic Catalyst	== 
Nanite Gain:	15 Nanites
Action:			2 Actions
Duration:		10 turns or 2 hits
Range:			Touch

    	An adhesive mist of kinetic-reactive ions that cause ceramic
armor plates to absorb hits more efficiently by powdering instead of cracking.
Toxic, but slow-acting to most biologic life forms. Can only be used on 
cybernetic allies with light, medium, heavy or full armor. An engineer only 
carries four doses per engagement. Reduces the next bullet hit by 35 points of 
damage. Looks kinda like yellow ooze. Gives an ally affected by Ceramic 
Catalyst a -20 penalty to visual stealth rolls. An engineer cannot use ceramic
catalyst on themselves. Ceramic Catalyst decays after exposure to elements for
ten turns or two hits, whichever happens first. 

== Microbot Swarm	== 
Nanite Gain:40 * n
Action:		1 Action
Duration: 	8 turns
Range:		4m radius

    You release a swarm of spider-like micro repair bots that repair 
cybernetic allies for 8 turns before running out of power. The microbots are 
able to heal 15 health per turn. The microbots burn up if one of their subjects
is affected by CS burn. For this, the engineer gains 40 * n Nanites, where n is 
the number of allies affected. The engineer can only perform this once per 
engagement. A Microassembler uses wireless cloud calculation to stay small, 
but on-blueprint. As such, it is vulnerable to hack checks at a DC of 50. A 
hacked micro assembler reveals its location and may deal 5 damage per turn.
The microbot swarm director automatically detects disobedient microbots.

===== Optronic/Cycotonic =====

== Repulsor Recharge	== 
Nanite Gain:	20 Nanites
Action:			1 Action
Duration:		Immediate
Range:			Touch

    	Recharges an ally's shield by 60 points. Cannot be used to
charge an ally's shields over their max value. An engineer cannot recharge
their own shields.

== Sensory Fuse	== 
Nanite Gain:	10 Nanites
Action:			1 Action
Duration:		Until fuse pops
Range:			Touch

    	You install an auto-ejecting Sensory Overload Fuse in your
cybernetic ally's audio and visual signal processors. The fuse pops and 
negates the effect of a flashbang or other such device. Fuses take a steady
hand to install, so an engineer cannot install one in themselves.

== B-Filter Buffer	== 
Nanite Gain:	15 Nanites
Action:			1 Action
Duration: 		For one visual perception check
Range:			Touch

    Adds a hyper-fast self-consuming buffer between a cybernetic ally's 
optics and their processor. This filter interfaces with the Bayer Filter to 
remove false artifacts and perform several Just-In-Time post processing. Uses 
a disposable one-time use paracrystal network that degrades after a time for 
optimal efficiency. Increases ally's visual perception by 10%.

== Repulsor Overcharge	== 
Nanite Gain:	25 Nanites
Action:			1 Action
Duration:		Immediate
Range:			Touch

    	Recharges an ally's shield by 60 points. May be used to charge
an ally's shields to up to 30 points above their maximum. Shields will 
normalize down to their maximum after ten turns. 

== Refractory Spray	== 
Nanite Gain:	15 Nanites
Action:			2 Actions
Duration:		Immediate
Range:			Touch

    	An adhesive mist of refractive particles that absorb laser and
plasma fire quite well. Toxic, but slow-acting to most biologic life forms. Can
only be used on cybernetic allies or terrain. An engineer only carries four 
doses per engagement. Reduces the next plasma/laser/CS hit by 35 points of 
damage and prevents the first damage-over-time effect from that hit, if it has
one. Looks kinda like sticky glitter. Gives an ally affected by Refractory 
spray a -20 penalty to visual stealth rolls. Refractory Spray can be detected
by metal detectors. Refractory Spray loses cohesion after ten turns or burns up
if hit by an energy attack.

== Tune Laser	== 
Nanite Gain:	30 Nanites
Action:			2 Actions
Duration:		5 Turns
Range:			Touch

    	You dial in the potentiometers and realign the focusing 
crystals. Your ally's weapon deals an extra 20 points of damage per hit
and has a -10% to miss (To a maximum of 0% when target is in light cover). 

== MoCap Augmentation	== 
Nanite Gain:	20 Nanites
Action:			2 Actions
Duration:		Immediate
Range:			Touch

    	By temporarily reducing the resolution of your cybernetic 
ally's visual sensors you radically reduce the processing power it takes to
capture motion, letting them process more frames per microsecond. This gives
them slightly faster reaction times, resulting in a -8% chance to miss when
attacking, but makes it much harder to see long distances. Allies with MoCap
Augmentation active take a -40 to perception checks at ranges beyond 50m. 
Since this is less than ideal in non-combat scenarios, you've set it to wear
off after ten turns.

== Repulsor Projection	== 
Nanite Gain:	10 Nanites
Action:			1 Action
Duration:		Immediate
Range:			10m

    	Recharges an ally's shield by 40 points. May not be used to
charge a shield above it's maximum capacity. An engineer may not charge their
own shields. 

== Repulsor Hypercharge	== 
Nanite Gain:	40 Nanites
Action:			2 Actions
Duration:		Immediate
Range:			Touch

    	Recharges an ally's shield by 85 points. May be used to charge
an ally's shields up to 60 points above their maximum. Shields will normalize
down to their maximum by 5 points per turn at the beginning of that player's
turn. Hypercharged shields make a distinctive crackling noise; players who's
shields are Hypercharged take a -20 to stealth rolls. An engineer cannot
Hypercharge their own shields.

== Broadcast Repulsion	== 
Nanite Gain:	15 * n Nanites, where n is the number of shields affected
Action:			2 Actions
Duration:		Immediate
Range:			8m radius centered on engineer

    	All allies with shields in the area of effect have their 
shields recharged by 40 points. This may not charge them over their maximum. If
more than two shields were affected and more than 60 points restored total, the
feedback wave sets a 10 damage per turn for 4 turns to any enemies in the area
of effect as well. A feedback wave ends the engineer's turn immediately.

== CS Lacer	== 
Nanite Gain:	20 Nanites
Action:			2 Actions
Duration:		10 Shots
Range:			Touch

    	You must pass a DC 40 skill check on your ally's weapon to 
replace their muzzle mod with a CS-Lacing capacitor. Their next ten shots 
set a 15 damage CS burn for 4 turns. After that ten shots, the Lacer's 
capacitor will have grounded and subsequent shots will jam the gun. Your
ally will have to make a skill check to swap back their muzzle attachment.

==============================
Build Tree
==============================

    Nanites are used to "glue" modular bits of tech together and to allow tech 
to function. After a certain amount of time the Nanites die and the item 
crumbles. At higher levels, the Nanites are able to last longer so the item can 
be used longer. 

    Drones do not count as "cybernetic allies" for most repair skills, though 
you can repair them with repair kits as normal. They take their turns 
independently, with 4 actions per turn, and they take their owner's (not 
necessarily their deployer's) initiative. A Drone can only use 4 IO ports at a 
time unless otherwise stated. 

    Unlocking a Build tree skill requires having unlocked the skill below it on 
the tree. Please see the Engineer Skill Tree - Build.png for dependencies.

===== Embedded Systems =====
== Dragonfly	== 
Type: 				Drone
Construction Cost:	40 Nanites
Control Point Cost: 1 point
Build Time:			4 Actions
Modular I/O ports: 	1 port
Duration: 			Permanent
Health:				20
Speed:				6m per Action
Roaming range:		6m from deployer.
Size:				.5m x .5m x .2m
Disrupt DC:			30
Pwn DC:				70

    The dragonfly is a small, light, fast flying drone that stays close
to it's deployer. Unlike most drones, it cannot use external network motes to 
increase its range.  It's onboard sensor network gives it's deployer a +6 to 
perception rolls. It's landing gear can also grasp and carry objects weighing
less than 8kg. Powered by a Li+ battery, will almost never explode when 
destroyed. Due to it's not-quite-quiet rotors, limits deployer's stealth scores
to a maximum of 75. If the deployer moves outside of its 6m service range, the
dragonfly will passively move to the nearest point to it that is in range. Due 
to its small size and jerky flight movement, a Dragonfly that moved on the same 
turn that it is shot at adds a 25% chance for the attacker to miss.

    When a drone is reclaimed, it frees up the control point cost that it 
occupied, but does not reimburse its controller's Nanites that were used to 
assemble it.

== KRO-W5	== 
Type: 				Drone
Construction Cost:	60 Nanites
Control Point Cost: 1 point
Build Time:			6 Actions
Modular I/O ports: 	3 ports
Duration: 			Permanent
Health:				46
Speed (unladen):	8m per Action. 
Speed (laden):      6m per Action if a port contains a peripheral.
Roaming range:		10m from network mote.
Size:				.5m x .1m x .2m
Disrupt DC:			80
Pwn DC:				120

    		The KRO-W5 or "Crow" is a lightweight quad-rotor drone 
designed for low-altitude operation. Combining agility with modularity. Its
onboard targeting laser gives the ally nearest to it a +10 bonus to accuracy 
against the nearest enemy that it has line of sight to. It also has a redundant
kernel checksum system to make hacking it more difficult. While unladen, its
rotors run slightly quieter than most; as long as it isn't carrying anything 
and its ports are unused, it has a maximum stealth check of 90. It runs on a
Li+ battery and almost never explodes when destroyed. The Crow doesn't come
with landing gear typically, so to get it to carry something other than a 
peripheral an engineer would have to jerry rig something on to it. See GM for 
Role Playing options. 

    When a drone is reclaimed, it frees up the control point cost that it 
occupied, but does not reimburse its controller's Nanites that were used to 
assemble it.

== PD-5 Scout Bot	== 
Type: 				Drone
Construction Cost:	60 Nanites
Control Point Cost: 1 point
Build Time:			6 Actions
Modular I/O ports: 	5 ports
Duration: 			Permanent
Health:				86
Speed:				9m per Action if unladen and health is over 80. 
					-4m per action if health < 80. -2m per action if a 
					peripheral has changed health total.
Roaming range:		10m from network mote.
Size:				1m x .6m x .8m
Disrupt DC:			50
Pwn DC:				90

    		This small bipedal drone comes equipped with a distributed
computing NIC card for improved performance in large packs. The PD-5 also comes 
standard with a biometric sharp grasping claws and a tail that adapts 
procedurally to maintain balance at high speeds as  well as significantly more
capacity for peripherals than its flying brethren. The Grasping claws may make 
melee attacks at a 40% chance to miss for 40 damage ignoring armor. PD-5 bots 
take a -20% to miss for each other friendly PD-5 within 6m due to their 
distributed network architecture, but if one PD bot is pwned, all PD bots within
that range are pwned as well. Disrupted PD-5 bots don't count for other's 
accuracy bonus.

    Standard PD bots make soft hydraulic sounds when moving, and so may not have 
stealth scores over 80. This limitation may be solved with clever RP, see your
GM with ideas.  

    When a drone is reclaimed, it frees up the control point cost that it 
occupied, but does not reimburse its controller's Nanites that were used to 
assemble it.

== Con-D0R	== 
Type: 				Drone
Construction Cost:	55 Nanites
Control Point Cost: 1 point
Build Time:			6 Actions
Modular I/O ports: 	4 ports
Duration: 			Permanent
Health:				56
Speed:				14 per action
Roaming range:		30 from network mote.
Size:				1m x .6m x .8m
Disrupt DC:			40
Pwn DC:				80

    		The reCON Direct zero Robot is right where you need it to 
be. Or if not, It'll be there extremely soon. While it lacks a little in armor, 
it is the fastest drone available and carries a decent payload of peripherals.
Unfortunately, it's long range carrier wave makes it a little more prone to 
cyber attacks than it's slower ilk. If the Con-D0R agile-wing drone has moved 
at least 10m in the last turn, enemies on the ground take a +20% to miss shooting
at it. If the Con-D0R has less than half of its ports occupied, enemies on the 
ground take an additional +10% when this effect is active.

    When a drone is reclaimed, it frees up the control point cost that it 
occupied, but does not reimburse its controller's Nanites that were used to 
assemble it.

== Cerberus Attack Drone	== 
Type: 				Drone
Construction Cost:	220 Nanites
Control Point Cost: 2 points
Build Time:			8 Actions
Modular I/O ports: 	9 ports
Duration: 			Permanent
Health:				216
Speed:				4m per Action
Roaming range:		8m from network mote.
Size:				1m x .8m x 1m
Disrupt DC:			30
Pwn DC:				70

    		Cerberus attack drones are large, heavily armored and armed
battlefield behemoths that move slowly but pack a nasty bite. Powered by an 
uberfuel that tends to explode in a 3m radius when destroyed. They move slowly
and have trouble with stairs, but their turret can quickly turn and fire. They
come with armor that covers 80% of their systems and reduces incoming fire by 
30 points. One anti-vehicle hit will down them however. Large enough for a 
player to take partial cover behind. 

    When a drone is reclaimed, it frees up the control point cost that it 
occupied, but does not reimburse its controller's Nanites that were used to 
assemble it.

== Titan Multipurpose Drone	== 
Type: 				Drone
Construction Cost:	350 Nanites
Control Point Cost: 4 points
Build Time:			8 Actions
Modular I/O ports: 	13 ports
Duration: 			Permanent

Roaming range:		20m from network mote.
Size:				1.2m x 1.2m x 2.4m
Disrupt DC:			30
Pwn DC:				70

    		The titan multipurpose drone is a bipedal megalith of death
and science. Plasma induction core explodes violently when destroyed. 
The titan comes with a 7.62 repeater that has a 20% chance to miss and deals 55 
damage. fed from a 150 round drum. May also make melee attacks with its offhand.
20% chance to miss. Deals 160 damage, kinda like being punched by a backhoe.

    When a drone is reclaimed, it frees up the control point cost that it

== Peripheral: popgun	== 
Type:				Peripheral
Construction Cost:	50 Nanites
Build Time:			2 Actions
Modular I/O ports:	Uses 1 port
Ammo:				Holds 20 shots
Accuracy:			30%
Damage:				40 points
Range:				30m
Drone Health:		+15

    A simple 9mm repeater module bolted to the universal adapter ports on a 
drone. Reloading takes 2 Actions, but always succeeds and never crits. Drones 
reload with perfect consistency. Additional ammo available as a separate
peripheral. As a unique ability, may have red lasers or suppressors added.

    Attachments added to a drone are returned when the drone is reclaimed.

== Peripheral: Ammo	== 
Type:				Peripheral
Construction Cost:	20 Nanites
Build Time:			2 Actions
Modular I/O ports:	Uses 1 port
Ammo:				Holds 3 full refills.

    Ammo storage and adaptive refitting subsystem all rolled into one. May only 
reload one weapon peripheral per Action, but may reload the weapon peripherals
of other drones. Also adds 30 health to a drone.

== Peripheral: Tazer	== 
Type:				Peripheral
Construction Cost:	40 Nanites
Build Time:			2 Actions
Modular I/O ports:	Uses 1 port
Ammo:				Holds 4 shots
Accuracy:			20%
Damage:				20 points
Range:				20m

    How does 40 kV feel? Does 7x damage to shields. Does 4x damage to drones or 
robotic enemies. If an enemy was hit with this attack, and the drone this was
launched with has not yet left the 20m range (i.e. the tazer wires are still
connected) you may spend one shot that automatically hits as a free action.
Sentient targets hit by this attack must pass a DC 80 shock check to keep from
being paralyzed on their following turn. 

== Peripheral: Armor	== 
Type:				Peripheral
Construction Cost:	25 Nanites
Build Time:			2 Actions
Modular I/O ports:	Uses 1 port
Coverage:			+50%
Reduction:			20 points
Drone health:		+46 points
Slowdown:			1m/Action
Sometimes, you just need a drone to be able to take a hit. Occupied I/O port 
allows armor diagnostics and triggering of reactive ballistic cells.

== Peripheral: Shield Capacitor	== 
Type:				Peripheral
Construction Cost:	60 Nanites
Build Time:			2 Actions
Modular I/O ports:	Uses 2 ports
Capacity:			80 points
Recharge:			20 points/turn after 3 turns without hit
Slowdown:			1m/Action

    Both I/O ports tapped for power. Primary port runs diagnostic info and CS
pulse frequency. Glows a neon color, -20 to drone stealth checks. 

== Peripheral: Minigun	== 
Type:				Peripheral

Modular I/O ports:	Uses 3 ports
Ammo:				Holds 60 shots
Accuracy:			30%
Damage:				20 points per bullet
Range:				60m
Drone Health:		+20

    Fires 3 bullets per shot which are individually rolled. In order to unlock,
engineer must have unlocked antennae and shield capacitor peripherals.

== Peripheral: Antennae	== 
Type:				Peripheral
Construction Cost:	40 Nanites
Build Time:			4 Action
Range:				+10m

    A multiphasic antennae, DSP module and strong amplifier allows your drones
to extend their service range. Multiple channels of transmission make your
drones easier to detect electronically, but harder to Pwn. +20 DC to enemy
Pwn attempts.

===== Statics =====

== Insta-Cover	== 
Type:			Structure
Build Cost:		30 Nanites
Build Time:		2 Actions
Duration:		Permanent
Health:			2 Vehicle Health
Size:			2m x .2m x .8m

    	Sometimes the low-tech solution is best. You unfold a series of
armadillo ceramic and carbon nanotube plates that are pretty good at stopping
bullets. This gives partial cover for 2 meters in one direction. 

== Barbed Wire	== 
Type:			Structure
Build Cost:		20 Nanites
Build Time:		1 Action
Duration:		Permanent
Health:			60 health points; immune to bullets but not to slashing weapons.
Size:			1m x .1m x .3m

    You keep a coil of barbed wire for those times when you need to politely 
discourage someone from going a particular way. The barbed wire is clearly 
visible, and any character attempting to move out of a space occupied by barbed 
wire must pass a DC 70 FORT check. A character in/on barbed wire takes 30 
slashing/cutting damage for every 2 actions or after every second action. Barbed 
wire does not hinder certain ethereal characters. Barbed wire does not hinder 
most vehicles, but it can pop tires.			

== Adaptive Gun Mount	== 
Type:			Structure
Build Cost:		10 Nanites
Build Time:		2 Actions
Duration:		Permanent
Health:			46 health
Size:			.5m x .5m x .1m

    	You set up a recoil-dampening weapon stand that grants partial
cover and a +10% accuracy bonus to whomever sets up here. Will fit in windows,
off the back of a truck, etc. Adheres to a solid, flat surface. Engineer who
built it gets 10 Nanites every time an ally hits a target using their gun mount.
does not proc for an engineer using their own mount.


== Gun Emplacement	== 
Type: 		Structure
Construction Cost:60 Nanites
Build Time:	2 Actions
Duration: 	Permanent
Health:		1 vehicle health
Size:		1m x 1m x 1m

    You piece together a heavy turret with a 200 round 5.56 caliber belt
of ammo. The ballistic plate in front offers partial cover for whomever uses it.
Each hit deals 53 damage and the gun has a 30% chance to miss. It cannot be 
aimed, but it can be ripped off of its emplacement by a character that has 8 
strength or more. When ripped off, the gun has an additional 10% chance to 
miss. If the gun is fired four times, with four consecutive actions, the
shooter gets a free fifth shot. Every hit that an ally (not you) makes with a
turret that you placed gives you 30 Nanites. Supporting Fire weapon.

== Snare == 
Type:				Trap
Construction Cost:	5 Nanites
Build Time:			1 Action
Disarm DC:			30%
Damage:				0 points
Range:				1 particular square meter

    DC 20 + (20 * Engineer character Level) for an enemy to  spot with a max of 
90. When a character steps on a snare, their movement ends. They may not move 
until they pass a DC 60 Fortitude check. An additional fortitude check may be 
made at the cost of 1 action. If the engineer who made this is at least level 5 
and has an intelligence of at least 8, the DC to escape is 80. If Int 8 and 
level > 10, DC is 120. Snares burn if damaged with fire or plasma and break if 
slashed. Snares may be shot, but are considered 'hunkered behind cover' at all 
times. Snares cannot be detected with detect high tech. Snares will trap 
friendly characters.

may affix a claymore to any hard, flat surface.

== Scavenge	== 
Type:			Action
Nanite Cost:	20
Scrap Time:		2 Actions
Range:			Touch

    	You gather materials from fallen foes or derelict equipment in 
the field to replenish your stock of components. You gain an amount of Nanites
depending on the condition, size, complexity and familiarity of what you are
scavenging. Your GM gets the final say on what your returns are, as a baseline,
an enemy Detachment Security Drone would be worth about 80 Nanites. You cannot
Scavenge active machinery. Some machinery may be too complex to scavenge or may
be incompatible with your microassembler.


== Light Mortar	== 
Type: 		Structure
Construction Cost:160 Nanites
Build Time:	8 Actions

Health:		1 vehicle health
Size:		2m x 2m x 2m

    That's it. You've just had it with those ###holes behind cover over
there taking potshots at you and your squad. This oughta teach 'em. You 
construct a mortar tube and shell printer. Deals 65 damage in a 2m radius
around a hit target with a 30% chance to miss. One shell "clip" takes 2 
actions to reload. 130m range with a high arc. Ignores cover penalties if the 
shell comes straight down on top of the target. Successful hits have a 30%
chance to daze the target. Every hit that an ally (not you) makes with a
mortar that you placed gives you 40 Nanites. Each emplacement comes with 
ten shells and may be refilled at a cost of 100 Nanites.

ten shells and may be refilled at a cost of 100 Nanites. 50m minimum range.

== Remote ANFO	== 
Type:				Trap
Construction Cost:	60 Nanites
Build Time:			1 Action
Disarm DC:			80%
Damage:				250 points or 4 vehicle damage
Range:				6m radius

    "um... sir, should you be... are you cleared to have that?" Won't detonate 
if shot. Even with plasma. And, boy does this sucker pack a punch. DC of 30 to 
hack it and set it off early. Setting one gives you a remote that can easily be 
held in an off hand, even if using a 2 handed weapon. If a teammate detonates 
the ANFO, the engineer that set it gains 10 Nanites. Anyone within 9m radius of 
the blast gets an "ears are ringing" status effect which gives a -90% to 
perception checks based on sound for three turns. Remote ANFO comes in a sticky 
bundle and will cling to any shaped hard surface. It will even cling to the 
wings of dropships during reentry.

===== Force Multiplier =====

== Bubble Shield	== 
Type: 		Structure
Construction Cost:40 Nanites
Build Time:	2 Actions
Duration: 	30 rounds or end of encounter
Health:		30
Size:		1m x 1m x 1m

    You set up a local shield generator that creates a 4m radius dome
shield that nobody can shoot through, but anyone can walk through or melee
through. The shield will stop 120 damage per turn or one vehicle damage
before popping. Once a shield has popped, it will need to be repaired at a cost
of 20 Nanites and 2 actions. Cannot be repaired more than twice.


== Entrench	== 
Type:			Structure
Build Cost:		50 Nanites
Build Time:		8 Actions
Duration:		Permanent
Health:			4 Vehicle Health
Size:			Various

    	Perhaps one of your most useful talents is being able to 
quickly cobble together good cover from whatever is lying about and what
you brought in your pack. Sometimes this means ripping up the floor, digging
into the ground to make a simple pillbox, sometimes this means bolting some
ceramic plates onto that coffee table over there and setting it where you
need it to be. However you pull it off, you manage to create a 2m x 2m area
of good cover for 360 degrees. 

== Spotter	== 
Type:			Drone
Build Cost:		30 Nanites
Build Time:		2 Actions
Duration:		Permanent
Health:			40 Points
Size:			.5m x .5m x .3m
Disrupt DC:		30
Pwn DC:			70

    	You create a specialized drone that will only follow a Marksman
who is friendly. The spotter takes its turn with that marksman, and takes 
orders from that marksman. It comes equipped with night vision, thermal imaging,
advanced audio sensor arrays and EM spectrum sweepers. It gives audio and visual
cues to what it sees. Unless otherwise specified, it's voice is that of an 
English butler's. It may make up to 3 perception checks per turn using the 
Marksman's perception modifier (since they are working as a team) at a bonus of
20 points. It does not need to roll perception to detect cloaked characters 
within 20m, since they show up like lit Christmas trees on the EM sweepers. In 
an emergency, the spotter may move up to 12m and self-destruct on a close-range
target, dealing 30 damage and emitting a flash similar to a flashbang. Spotters
cannot leave their marksman, and do not occupy a control point. Unlike many 
similar models, the spotter drone is quite stealthy.

== Darknet Processor	== 
Type:			Structure
Build Cost:		20 Nanites
Build Time:		4 Actions
Duration:		Permanent
Health:			80 points
Size:			.75 x .75. .5 (base) antennae is adjustable

    You didn't exactly understand what your priest was saying about what was in 
this thing, but you could tell he was quite excited. Something about hexadecimal 
core processor, radio and wireless peripherals, embedded botnet, altera SHIELD 
encryption accelerator, digital signal processor, signal triangulator and all 
wrapped up with a web application firewall. Allows any priest within 8m of the 
station to make wireless hacking checks with a +20 to rolls. Gives friendly 
drones in range a +10 to resist being hacked. Also provides four friendly 
network nodes, all isolated by separate firewalls. The engineer who deployed 
this gets 10 Nanites for each system disrupted and 20 Nanites for each system 
pwned using this antennae. 

== Noisy Cricket	== 
Type:			Disposable munition system
Build Cost:		55 Nanites
Build Time:		2 Actions
Duration:		until it runs out of ammo
Range:			60m
Accuracy:		25% to miss
Clip:			4
Damage:			60 within 1m radius of hit.

    "I uh... haven't figured out how to fit the cartridge into a magazine 
without it ... you know... exploding. But what's in it should work just fine." 
You hand an allied gunslinger a little sidearm that has been your pet project 
for a while. Ignores shields. After every shot, the player who fired it rolls 
luck. If they roll over 80 (modified), all enemies who took damage have their 
shields wink out due to EMP. If they roll under 10, their shields and any nearby 
allies within 5m of them lose their shields due to EMP. Does not effect the 
function of drones or robots. Every enemy hit with the noisy cricket gives 30 
Nanites to the engineer who built it.

== Overshield Inductor	== 
Type:			Drone
Build Cost:		40 Nanites
Build Time:		2 Actions
Duration:		Permanent
Health:			20 Points
Size:			.5m x .5m x .3m

    You create a small flying drone that follows one particular ally (not you). 
The drone carries an adaptive resonator and Nanite shield inductor that 
overcharges your teammate's shields to 40 points above their usual max. It also 
heals any damage to your teammate's shields by 20 points at the end of your 
teammate's turn every turn. It's not really quiet though, so the teammate that 
the drone is following cannot score stealth rolls above 70. For every 20 points 
(including the first 40 of over-heal) of shield strength that the drone heals, 
the engineer who built it gets 15 Nanites in return.

== Pointer	== 
Type: 				Drone
Construction Cost:	50 Nanites
Control Point Cost: 0 points
Build Time:			4 Actions
Modular I/O ports: 	2 ports
Duration: 			Permanent
Health:				86
Speed:				8m per Action.
Roaming range:		10m from imprinted hunter.
Size:				1m x .6m x .8m
Disrupt DC:			60
Pwn DC:				90

    You construct a quadrupedal drone and upload the canine AI to it's 
processor. You imprint your team's hunter upon it. The pointer comes 
prefabricated with a head-mounted 12-gauge peripheral with 10 shots. It also has 
a "point" behavior which it uses to highlight targets for its master. The hunter 
who owns the pointer gets -15% to miss a highlighted target. A pointer cannot 
fire while pointing. Pointers are not quiet and cap stealth scores at 80. 
Shotgun deals 80 dam out to 3m, 65 out to 10m, 50 out to 20m.

== Medic Drone	== 
Type:			Drone
Build Cost:		40 Nanites
Build Time:		2 Actions
Duration:		Permanent
Health:			20 Points
Size:			.5m x .5m x .3m
Disrupt DC:		30
Pwn DC:			70

    You set up and deploy a MD-413 surgical assistant hover drone. It follows 
one particular medic and speeds up all Hippocratic procedures to 1 action (no 
effect if an action would be just one action or faster anyway). It also adds a 
+15 to medical skill checks and adds a +15 to perception checks made by that 
medic. The medic drone does not cost any control points. The engineer who 
deployed the medic drone is able to reclaim 10 Nanites every time the medic uses 
the drone to heal something. Medic drones are not quiet and limit a medic to a 
stealth score of 75 while active.

== BFG	== 
Type:			Disposable munition system
Build Cost:		75 Nanites
Build Time:		2 Actions
Duration:		until it runs out of ammo
Range:			500m
Accuracy:		25%
Clip:			4 Ni U Rods
Damage:			120 points, ignores armor.

    You assemble a large antimatter slug impeller on the ground and instruct 
your weapons specialist to pick it up and use it until the cannister runs out. 
You explain that he shouldn't drop it, but don't break his brain with the 
physics behind it. The engineer that deploys this gets 30 Nanites per hit with 
this weapon.

== Cloaking Capacitor	== 
Type:			Wearable
Build Cost:		40 Nanites
Build Time:		2 Actions
Duration:		Permanent
Health:			40 Points
Size:			.5m x .5m x .3m

    you attach a Nanite capacitor to your teammate's cloaking armor, which 
allows it to maintain a cloak for 2 more turns. The engineer who deploys this 
gets 50 Nanites in return. A cloaking capacitor is detectable by detect high 
tech rolls above a 1.

== Defender	== 
Type: 				Drone
Construction Cost:	60 Nanites
Control Point Cost: 0 points
Build Time:			6 Actions
Modular I/O ports: 	3 ports
Duration: 			Permanent
Health:				72
Speed:				8m per Action if unladen. 6m per Action if a port contains
a peripheral.
Roaming range:		10m from Assigned Teammate.
Size:				.5m x .1m x .2m
Disrupt DC:			60
Pwn DC:				90

    You set up and deploy a quad rotor flying combat assist drone and task it to 
follow the direction of one of your allies (not you). While unladen, its rotors 
run slightly quieter than most; as long as it isn't carrying anything and its 
ports are unused, it has a maximum stealth check of 90. It runs on a Li+ battery 
and almost never explodes when destroyed. When a drone is reclaimed, it frees up 
the control point cost that it occupied, but does not reimburse its controller's 
Nanites that were used to assemble it.
