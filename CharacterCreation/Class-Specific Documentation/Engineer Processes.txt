==============================
Engineering Processes 
==============================

    As Engineers practice their craft, they learn certain processes. These are 
listed below. These Processes can be performed either under fire on the 
battlefield or between engagements under more calm circumstances. 

    Processes are divided into two categories; Repair Processes and Build 
Processes. Typically, a Repair Process is any process which heals or buffs a 
teammate. Repair Processes typically accrue building materials like Energy and 
Material. Build Processes typically increase an engineer's combat effectiveness 
through the deployment of drones or mounted weapons. Build Processes typically 
expend building materials like Energy and Materials. 

    Every time an Engineer levels up, they get one new Process from each of the
Build and Repair Process categories. Unlocking a Process requires having 
unlocked the Process below it on the Process Tree. Please see the "Engineer 
Process Tree - Repair.png" for dependencies.

Energy:
    Most procedures that an engineer can perform in the field requires the 
expenditure of a non-trivial amount of energy. During combat, an engineer may 
overcharge their standard issue batteries as outlined in the Engineer section of 
the 02_classes.txt document. When not in combat, energy is vented from the 
batteries down to their safe storage limit. If the batteries were to remain 
overcharged for longer than the duration of an encounter, they would burn out or 
burn up and explode depending on the limit. The max limit and safe storage limit 
are outlined in the "02_classes.txt" document in Character Creation. 

Materials:
    An engineer will often use an extruder or 3D printer in the field to 
construct helpful things like drones or cover in the heat of combat. To do this, 
the Engineer uses a resource called Material. An engineer's extruder has a 
built-in recycler which can be used to salvage usable material from a variety of 
sources. Often, recycling spent, unused or damaged parts is part of the standard 
procedure of a given process. Material accrued on mission persists between 
encounters and over small rests.

Munitions:
    Munitions are used in the engineer's extruder to print more ... active 
components. Due to regulations munitions extrusion material is not retained 
between combat encounters. 

Network Motes: 
    Any repair process that an engineer uses on a cybernetic ally (even if that 
process doesn't specify that it can only be used on cybernetic allies) leaves a 
"network mote" on that ally. When calculating roaming range of drones built in 
the build tree, the range of the drone is taken from the nearest network mote or 
the engineer that deployed it.

==============================
Repair Tree	
==============================

===== Cyberphysical =====

== Reboot	== 
Energy Gain:65
Action:		1 Action
Duration: 	N/A
Range:		Touch

    Only usable on cybernetic allies that are "bleeding" out. That ally
is now stable and has 30 hp, rather than having to stabilize the target and 
then heal them. Not a quiet procedure; detectable within 40m by a perception 
check of 30.

== Data Scrub	== 
Energy Gain: 35
Action:		 1 Action
Duration: 	 N/A
Range:		 Touch

    Only usable on cybernetic allies who have been hacked or dominated.
The engineer makes a repair check opposed by half of the hacker's hack check or
dominator's domination check. If the engineer wins, the ally or system is 
scrubbed and the system control returns to normal. The engineer only receives 
Energy for successful scrubs. Be aware that engineers are the only class with 
this Process, but not the only class that can scrub a hacked target.

== Restore Armor	== 
Energy Gain:   50
Action: 	   2 Actions
Duration:	   Almost Instant
Range: 		   Touch

    You tinker with your ally's armor and mend it. Undo any Debuffs on
your ally's armor such as sundering, battle damage, etc. 

== Percussive Maintenance	== 
Energy Gain:  30
Action:		  1 Action
Duration:	  Almost Instant
Range:		  Touch

    This stupid thing is broken again! You hit it with your wrench and
deal 10 damage to it. Roll luck modifier, with a DC of 1.5 x target's total 
damage after wrench hit. Add to that DC 10 for each minor status effect and
15 for each major status effect, at the GM's discretion. If The DC is passed,
Fix all minor status effects, one major status effect, or heal one wound. This
process may only be performed on cybernetic allies, turrets, vehicles or as
an RP event. Not to be confused with the concussive maintenance feat.

== Defrag	== 
Energy Gain:15
Action:		1 Action
Duration:	Until First Use
Range:		Touch

    You auto-balance your cybernetic ally's priority queues, defrag
their memory and basically perform typical maintenance. Feeling refreshed,
your ally continues on their way. Your ally gets a +5% bonus to their next
RP roll.

== Actuator Overdrive	== 
Energy Gain:20
Action:		1 Action
Duration: 	engagement
Range:		Touch

    For the duration of an engagement, an ally moves 3m per action more. Ally 
movement has an absolute cap of 14m per action, even if some other effect
would make it higher. A player may not be overdrived/overclocked more than 
once per engagement. Only works on cybernetic allies.


== Discrete Overclock	== 
Energy Gain:20
Action:		1 Action
Duration: 	Engagement
Range:		Touch

    A cybernetic ally gets a -1 to miss for the duration of the engagement. They 
also get a +15 to reloading weapons quickly and a +10 to perception checks. 
Cannot Overclock an Ally more than once per engagement.

== Network Targeting	== 
Energy Gain:20
Action:		1 Action
Duration:	Until First Use
Range:		Touch

    You interface a visual triangulation unit with your cybernetic 
ally's visual sensors. It cross-references targets with other friendly 
machine's sensors to deliver a more complete image of the target. Your
cybernetic ally gets a -1 to miss their next target for each friendly
drone, robot and turret that is also looking at that target. This effect
may be blocked with a hacking attack at DC 20. 

== System Overclock	== 
Energy Gain:35
Action:		1 Action
Duration: 	Engagement
Range:		Touch

    A cybernetic ally gets a -2 to miss for the duration of the engagement.
They also get a +35 to reloading weapons quickly and a +10 to perception checks, 
but take 20 damage from system overheat.

== Colocation Processing	== 
Energy Gain:20
Action:		1 Action
Duration:	Until First Use
Range:		6m

    You use your onboard manufacturing system processor as a dedicated
server to help process your cybernetic ally's analytic data. The next time that
ally makes a lockpick, hacking, explosives, repair, heal, or tracking check, 
they get a +15 to it. 

== Regression Override	== 
Energy Gain:60
Action:		1 Action
Duration:	8 Turns
Range:		Touch

    You temporarily disable your cybernetic ally's regression process,
the part of their personality program that slows down to triple check the 
results of their actions. This sends them into a rage mode. They still know
friend from foe, and they still have a jenky understanding of their higher-
order skills like lockpicking, hacking, or social finesse, but they have no
fear, no pain, no remorse and no hesitation for about half of a minute. Your
ally Cannot feel shock during this duration, and cannot be repaired (they
won't stand still). They get a bonus +3 to accuracy nearer than 41m. They
also deal an extra 20 damage with melee or fire an extra bullet with rapid-
fire weapons. They take a penalty of -25% to skill checks, including acrobat or
parkour checks (these take regression to calculate). An ally affected by 
Regression Override may use a strength +2 bonus at any time, but each time they
do, they take 20 damage of wear and tear. An engineer can only perform a 
regression override once per encounter. Regression Overrides do not stack.

== System Restore	== 
Energy Gain:35
Action:		2 Actions
Duration: 	Permanent
Range:		Touch

    Can only be used on a cybernetic subject who's primary data center is still 
intact that has "bled out" less than 8 turns ago. The Engineer makes a DC 60 
Repair check. If successful, the subject is now "bleeding out". If the subject 
is saved, they get the feat "Refurbished". Characters with the "Refurbished" 
feat have a permanent -1 to Intelligence and can never again be revived with 
System Restore.

===== Material/Mechanic =====

== Duct Tape	== 
Energy Gain:40
Action:		1 Action
Duration: 	N/A
Range:		Touch

    Ok, there was a little more to it than that. One of your targets wounds are 
healed. This trick only works on cybernetic allies, non-sentient robots and 
machinery.

== Weapon Tuning	== 
Energy Gain:20
Action:		1 Action
Duration: 	engagement
Range:		Touch

    You fiddle with your ally's gun quickly. You tune the whosits, and
dial the whatsits. It now has a -1 chance to miss and has half the chance of
jamming round down. Normal use and wear on the gun will almost definitely 
unalign what you've done by the end of the engagement, but hopefully your 
efforts will help keep your ally alive until then.

== Vehicle Repair	== 
Energy Gain:40
Action:		4 Actions
Duration:	almost instant
Range:		Touch

    You pull out your tools and quickly repair the damage to a friendly
vehicle. It gains 1 vehicle health. While this power is not required to repair
vehicles, it does add a Nanite reward for doing so. It also increases the 
effect and may reduce the time taken to repair. 


== Multisys Repair	== 
Energy Gain:30*n
Action:		1 Action
Duration: 	N/A
Range:		Touch

    The cybernetic ally is healed by the Engineer's heal roll / n, where n is 
the number of wounds that the cybernetic ally has. This trick only works on 
cybernetic beings or machines.

== Micro Assembler	== 
Energy Gain:50
Action:		1 Action
Duration: 	8 turns
Range:		Touch

    You release a spider-like micro repair bot that repairs a cybernetic
ally for 8 turns before running out of power. The microbot is able to heal
15 health per turn. Once spent, the microbot burns up in CS burn. A 
Microassembler uses wireless cloud calculation to stay small, but on-blueprint. 
As such, it is vulnerable to hack checks at a DC of 50. A hacked micro assembler 
reveals its location and may deal 5 damage per turn.

== Engine Tuning	== 
Energy Gain:50
Action:		6 Actions
Duration: 	Almost Instant
Range:		Touch

    You crack open the hood of whatever vehicle is around and begin to
clean the spark plug, dial in the cylinder timing and add your own special
sauce to the engine's fuel injector. It will now run at 125% power, and it has
full health. Effect may vary by RP. See GM for details. While this power is not
required to boost the effect of a vehicle, it now rewards you in Energy for
doing so and increases your effectiveness at doing so.

== Boilerplate Handiwork	== 
Energy Gain:   20 Energy
Material Cost: 20 Material
Action:		   1 Action
Duration: 	   Permanent
Range:		   Touch

    Just slam some more metal on there! You add a protective layer to
one of your cybernetic allies. This adds 40 to their health, but slows them
down by 1m per action. This effect lasts until that 40 health has been 
destroyed, or until the engineer takes it off and discards it.

== Zero Friction Covalent	== 
Energy Gain:20
Action:		1 Action
Duration: 	Until next melee hit
Range:		Touch

    You coat your ally's weapon with a friction-negating substance that
binds with the blade on the molecular level, which makes it easier to slice 
through targets. Add one to the weapon's damage multiplier. The substance isn't
very durable and is difficult to handle, so an engineer can't use it on their
own weapon and the effect only lasts until the next hit. Cannot be used on a 
weapon more than once at a time.

== Sup it Up	== 
Energy Gain:80
Action:		12 Actions
Duration: 	8 turns
Range:		Touch

    Target friendly vehicle has full health, and its engine runs at
maximum efficiency. Full effect is up to Role Playing and GM. Additions
include but are not limited to:

*  adding a NOS tank
*  adding a 1-vehicle damage shield
*  adding stabilized chassis for improved accuracy when fired from 

== Ceramic Catalyst	== 
Energy Gain:	15 Energy
Action:			2 Actions
Duration:		10 turns or 2 hits
Range:			Touch

    An adhesive mist of kinetic-reactive ions that cause ceramic armor plates to 
absorb hits more efficiently by powdering instead of cracking. Toxic, but 
slow-acting to most biologic life forms. Can only be used on cybernetic allies 
with light, medium, heavy or full armor. Reduces the next bullet hit by 35 
points of damage. Looks kinda like yellow ooze. Gives an ally affected by 
Ceramic Catalyst a -20 penalty to visual stealth rolls. An engineer cannot use 
ceramic catalyst on themselves. Ceramic Catalyst decays after exposure to 
elements for ten turns or two hits, whichever happens first. 

== Microbot Swarm	== 
Energy Gain:40 * n
Action:		1 Action
Duration: 	8 turns
Range:		4m radius

    You release a swarm of spider-like micro repair bots that repair 
cybernetic allies for 8 turns before running out of power. The microbots are 
able to heal 15 health per turn. The microbots burn up if one of their subjects
is affected by plasma burn. For this, the Engineer gains 40 * n Energy, where n 
is the number of allies affected. The Engineer can only perform this once per 
engagement. A Microassembler uses wireless cloud calculation to stay small, 
but on-blueprint. As such, it is vulnerable to hack checks at a DC of 50. A 
hacked micro assembler reveals its location and may deal 5 damage per turn.
The microbot swarm director automatically detects disobedient microbots and 
notifies the Engineer. 

===== Optronic/Cycotonic =====

== Repulsor Recharge	== 
Energy Gain:	20 Energy
Action:			1 Action
Duration:		Immediate
Range:			Touch

    	Recharges an ally's shield by 60 points. Cannot be used to
charge an ally's shields over their max value. An Engineer cannot recharge
their own shields.

== Sensory Fuse	== 
Energy Gain:	10 Energy
Action:			1 Action
Duration:		Until fuse pops
Range:			Touch

    	You install an auto-ejecting Sensory Overload Fuse in your
cybernetic ally's audio and visual signal processors. The fuse pops and 
negates the effect of a flashbang or other such device. Fuses take a steady
hand to install, so an engineer cannot install one in themselves.


== B-Filter Buffer	== 
Energy Gain:	15 Energy
Action:			1 Action
Duration: 		For one visual perception check
Range:			Touch

    Adds a hyper-fast self-consuming buffer between a cybernetic ally's 
optics and their processor. This filter interfaces with the Bayer Filter to 
remove false artifacts and perform several Just-In-Time post processing. Uses 
a disposable one-time use paracrystal network that degrades after a time for 
optimal efficiency. Increases ally's visual perception by 10%.

== Repulsor Overcharge	== 
Energy Gain:	25 Energy
Action:			1 Action
Duration:		Immediate
Range:			Touch

    	Recharges an ally's shield by 60 points. May be used to charge
an ally's shields to up to 30 points above their maximum. Shields will 
normalize down to their maximum after ten turns. 

== Refractory Spray	== 
Energy Gain:	15 Energy
Material Cost:  15 Material
Action:			2 Actions
Duration:		Immediate
Range:			Touch

    An adhesive mist of refractive particles that absorb laser and plasma fire 
quite well. Reduces the next plasma/laser/VAE hit by 35 points of damage and 
prevents the first damage-over-time effect from that hit, if it has one. Looks 
kinda like sticky glitter. Gives an ally affected by Refractory spray a -20 
penalty to visual stealth rolls. Refractory Spray can be detected by metal 
detectors. Refractory Spray loses cohesion after ten turns or burns up if hit by 
an energy attack.

== Tune Laser	== 
Energy Gain:	30 Energy
Action:			2 Actions
Duration:		5 Turns
Range:			Touch

    You dial in the potentiometers and realign the focusing crystals. Your 
ally's laser weapon deals an extra 20 points of damage per hit and has a -1 to 
miss (To a minimum to-miss of -0 when target is in light cover). 

== MoCap Augmentation	== 
Energy Gain:	20 Energy
Action:			2 Actions
Duration:		Immediate
Range:			Touch

    By temporarily reducing the resolution of your cybernetic ally's visual 
sensors you radically reduce the processing power it takes to capture motion, 
letting them process more frames per microsecond. This gives them slightly 
faster reaction times, resulting in a -1 chance to miss when attacking, but 
makes it much harder to see long distances. Allies with MoCap Augmentation 
active take a -40 to perception checks at ranges beyond 50m. Since this is less 
than ideal in non-combat scenarios, you've set it to wear off after ten turns.

== Repulsor Projection	== 
Energy Gain:	10 Energy
Action:			1 Action
Duration:		Immediate
Range:			10m

    Recharges an ally's shield by 40 points. May not be used to charge a shield 
above it's maximum capacity. An engineer may not charge their own shields. 

== Repulsor Hypercharge	== 
Energy Gain:	40 Energy
Action:			2 Actions
Duration:		Immediate
Range:			Touch

    Recharges an ally's shield by 85 points. May be used to charge an ally's 
shields up to 60 points above their maximum. Shields will normalize down to 
their maximum by 5 points per turn at the beginning of that player's turn. 
Hypercharged shields make a distinctive crackling noise; players who's shields 
are Hypercharged take a -20 to stealth rolls. An Engineer cannot Hypercharge 
their own shields.

== Broadcast Repulsion	== 
Energy Gain:	15 * n Energy, where n is the number of shields affected
Action:			2 Actions
Duration:		Immediate
Range:			8m radius centered on engineer

    All allies with shields in the area of effect have their shields recharged 
by 40 points. This may not charge them over their maximum. If more than two 
shields were affected and more than 60 points restored total, the feedback wave 
sets a 10 damage per turn for 4 turns to any enemies in the area of effect as 
well. A feedback wave ends the Engineer's turn immediately.

== Plasma Lacer	== 
Energy Gain:	20 Energy and 1 Munitions
Action:			2 Actions
Duration:		10 Shots
Range:			Touch

	You must pass a DC 40 skill check on your ally's weapon to replace their 
muzzle mod with a Plasma-Lacing capacitor. Their next ten shots set a 2 tokens 
of Plasma Burn. After that ten shots, the Lacer's capacitor will have grounded 
and subsequent shots will jam the gun. Your ally will have to make a skill check 
to swap back their muzzle attachment.

==============================
Build Tree
==============================

    The build processes that an Engineer employs allow them to be constructed
quickly in the field using the Engineer's multipurpose extruder tool.

    Drones do not count as "cybernetic allies" for most repair skills, though 
you can repair them with repair kits as normal. They take their turns 
independently, with 4 actions per turn, and they take their owner's (not 
necessarily their deployer's) initiative. A Drone can only use 4 IO ports at a 
time unless otherwise stated. 

    Unlocking a Build tree skill requires having unlocked the skill below it on 
the tree. Please see the Engineer Skill Tree - Build.png for dependencies.

===== Embedded Systems =====

== Dragonfly	== 
Type: 				Drone
Construction Cost:	30 Energy, 40 material 
Control Point Cost: 1 point
Build Time:			4 Actions
Modular I/O ports: 	1 port
Duration: 			Permanent
Health:				20 Points
Speed:				6m per Action
Roaming range:		6m from deployer.
Size:				.5m x .5m x .2m
Disrupt DC:			30
Pwn DC:				70

    The dragonfly is a small, light, fast flying drone that stays close
to it's deployer. Unlike most drones, it cannot use external network motes to 
increase its range.  It's onboard sensor network gives it's deployer a +6 to 
perception rolls. It's landing gear can also grasp and carry objects weighing
less than 8kg. Powered by a Li+ battery, will almost never explode when 
destroyed. Due to it's not-quite-quiet rotors, limits deployer's stealth scores
to a maximum of 75. If the deployer moves outside of its 6m service range, the
dragonfly will passively move to the nearest point to it that is in range. Due 
to its small size and jerky flight movement, a Dragonfly that moved on the same 
turn that it is shot at adds a +3 chance for the attacker to miss.

    When a drone is reclaimed, it frees up the control point cost that it 
occupied, but does not reimburse its construction cost.

== KRO-W5	== 
Type: 				Drone
Construction Cost:	45 Energy, 50 Material
Control Point Cost: 1 point
Build Time:			6 Actions
Modular I/O ports: 	3 ports
Duration: 			Permanent
Health:				46 Points
Speed (unladen):	8m per Action. 
Speed (laden):      6m per Action if a port contains a peripheral.
Roaming range:		10m from network mote.
Size:				.5m x .1m x .2m
Disrupt DC:			80
Pwn DC:				120

    		The KRO-W5 or "Crow" is a lightweight quad-rotor drone 
designed for low-altitude operation. Combining agility with modularity. Its
onboard targeting laser gives the ally nearest to it a +2 bonus to accuracy 
against the nearest enemy that it has line of sight to. It also has a redundant
kernel checksum system to make hacking it more difficult. While unladen, its
rotors run slightly quieter than most; as long as it isn't carrying anything 
and its ports are unused, it has a maximum stealth check of 90. It runs on a
Li+ battery and almost never explodes when destroyed. The Crow doesn't come
with landing gear typically, so to get it to carry something other than a 
peripheral an engineer would have to jerry rig something on to it. See GM for 
Role Playing options. 

    When a drone is reclaimed, it frees up the control point cost that it 
occupied, but does not reimburse its construction cost.


== PD-5 Scout Bot	== 
Type: 				Drone
Construction Cost:	50 Energy, 60 Material
Control Point Cost: 1 point
Build Time:			6 Actions
Modular I/O ports: 	5 ports
Duration: 			Permanent
Health:				86 Points
Speed:				9m per Action if unladen and health is over 80. 
					-4m per action if health < 80. -2m per action if a 
					peripheral has changed health total.
Roaming range:		10m from network mote.
Size:				1m x .6m x .8m
Disrupt DC:			50
Pwn DC:				90
Natural Armor coverage: 70%
Natural APL:        3
Natural AP Strength: 80

    This small bipedal drone comes equipped with a distributed computing NIC 
card for improved performance in large packs. The PD-5 also comes standard with 
a biometric sharp grasping claws and a tail that adapts procedurally to maintain 
balance at high speeds as  well as significantly more capacity for peripherals 
than its flying brethren. The Grasping claws may make melee attacks with a bonus
of 4 for 40 damage. PD-5 bots take a -2 to miss for each other friendly PD-5 
within 6m due to their distributed network architecture, but if one PD bot is 
pwned, all PD bots within that range are pwned as well. Disrupted PD-5 bots 
don't count for other's accuracy bonus.

    Standard PD bots make soft hydraulic sounds when moving, and so may not have 
stealth scores over 80. This limitation may be solved with clever RP, see your
GM with ideas.  

    When a drone is reclaimed, it frees up the control point cost that it 
occupied, but does not reimburse its construction cost.

== Con-D0R	== 
Type: 				Drone
Construction Cost:	60 Energy, 30 Material
Control Point Cost: 1 point
Build Time:			6 Actions
Modular I/O ports: 	4 ports
Duration: 			Permanent
Health:				56 Points
Speed:				14 per action
Roaming range:		30 from network mote.
Size:				1m x .6m x .8m
Disrupt DC:			40
Pwn DC:				80

    The reCON Direct zero Robot is right where you need it to be. Or if not, 
It'll be there extremely soon. While it lacks a little in armor, it is the 
fastest drone available and carries a decent payload of peripherals. 
Unfortunately, its long range carrier wave makes it a little more prone to 
cyber attacks than its slower ilk. If the Con-D0R agile-wing drone has moved 
at least 10m in the last turn, enemies on the ground take a +2 to miss shooting
at it. If the Con-D0R has less than half of its ports occupied, enemies on the 
ground take an additional +1 when this effect is active.

    When a drone is reclaimed, it frees up the control point cost that it 
occupied, but does not reimburse its construction cost.

== Cerberus Attack Drone	== 
Type: 				Drone
Construction Cost:	110 Energy, 90 Material
Control Point Cost: 2 points
Build Time:			8 Actions
Modular I/O ports: 	9 ports
Duration: 			Permanent
Health:				216 Points
Speed:				4m per Action
Roaming range:		8m from network mote.
Size:				1m x .8m x 1m
Disrupt DC:			30
Pwn DC:				70

    Cerberus attack drones are large, heavily armored and armed battlefield 
behemoths that move slowly but pack a nasty bite. Powered by an uberfuel that 
tends to explode in a 3m radius when destroyed. Any entity caught in the blast
takes 3 burn tokens and 50 damage. They move slowly and have trouble with 
stairs, but their turret can quickly turn and fire. See the table below for 
stats on the armor of the drone when built by Engineers of different levels. 
One anti-vehicle hit will down them however. The Cerberus is large enough for a 
player to take partial cover behind. 

    When a drone is reclaimed, it frees up the control point cost that it 
occupied, but does not reimburse its construction cost.

    The titan multipurpose drone is a bipedal megalith of death and science. 
Plasma induction core explodes violently when destroyed. The titan comes with a 
7.62 repeater that has a 2 chance to miss and deals 55 damage and has an armor 
piercing level of 4 and an auto fire rate of 5. The repeater is a Heavy 
suppression weapon fed from a 150 round drum. May also make melee attacks with 
its offhand with a +3 bonus. Deals 160 damage, kinda like being punched by a 
backhoe.

Type:			Structure
Build Cost:		5 Energy and 25 Material
Build Time:		2 Actions
Duration:		Permanent
Health:			2 Vehicle Health
Size:			2m x .2m x .8m

    	Sometimes the low-tech solution is best. You unfold a series of
armadillo ceramic and carbon nanotube plates that are pretty good at stopping
bullets. This gives partial cover for 2 meters in one direction. 

== Barbed Wire	== 
Type:			Structure
Build Cost:		5 Energy and 15 Material
Build Time:		1 Action
Duration:		Permanent
Health:			60 health points; immune to bullets but not to slashing weapons.
Size:			1m x .1m x .3m

    You keep a coil of barbed wire for those times when you need to politely 
discourage someone from going a particular way. The barbed wire is clearly 
visible, and any character attempting to move out of a space occupied by barbed 
wire must pass a DC 70 FORT check. A character in/on barbed wire takes 30 
slashing/cutting damage for every 2 actions or after every second action. Barbed 
wire does not hinder certain ethereal characters. Barbed wire does not hinder 
most vehicles, but it can pop tires.

    You piece together a heavy turret with a 200 round 5.56 caliber belt
of ammo. The ballistic plate in front offers partial cover for whomever uses it.
This weapon can be ripped off of its emplacement by a character that has 8 
strength or more. When ripped off, the gun has an additional +1 chance to 
miss. If the gun is fired four times, with four consecutive Actions, the
shooter gets a free fifth shot. Every hit that an ally (not you) makes with a
turret that you placed gives you 30 Energy. 

== Snare == 
Type:				Trap
Construction Cost:	5 Energy and 5 Material
Build Time:			1 Action
Disarm DC:			30%
Damage:				0 points
Range:				1 particular square meter

    DC 20 + (20 * Engineer character Level) for an enemy to  spot with a max of 
90. When a character steps on a snare, their movement ends. They may not move 
until they pass a DC 60 Fortitude check. An additional fortitude check may be 
made at the cost of 1 action. If the engineer who made this is at least level 5 
and has an intelligence of at least 8, the DC to escape is 80. If Int 8 and 
level > 10, DC is 120. Snares burn if damaged with fire or plasma and break if 
slashed. Snares may be shot, but are considered 'hunkered behind cover' at all 
times. Snares cannot be detected with detect high tech. Snares will trap 
friendly characters.

may affix a claymore to any hard, flat surface.

== Scavenge	== 
Type:			Action
Energy Cost:	20
Scrap Time:		2 Actions
Range:			Touch

    	You gather materials from fallen foes or derelict equipment in 
the field to replenish your stock of components. You gain an amount of Material
depending on the condition, size, complexity and familiarity of what you are
scavenging. Your GM gets the final say on what your returns are, as a baseline,
an enemy Detachment Security Drone would be worth about 80 Material. You cannot
Scavenge active machinery. Some machinery may be too complex to scavenge or may
be incompatible with your microassembler.

    That's it. You've just had it with those ###holes behind cover over there 
taking potshots at you and your squad. This oughta teach 'em. You construct a 
mortar tube and shell printer. Deals 65 damage in a 2m radius around a hit 
target with a chance to miss of 3. One shell "clip" takes 2 actions to reload. 
130m range with a high arc. Ignores cover penalties if the shell comes straight 
down on top of the target. Successful hits have a 30% chance to daze the target. 
Every hit that an ally (not you) makes with a mortar that you placed gives you 
40 Energy. Each emplacement comes with ten shells and may be refilled at a cost 
of 100 Energy.

gets its own actions, and has the same initiative as the player who built it. 
Hacking DC of 40 to jam. Repair DC of 60 to fix a jam. Hacking DC of 90 to Pwn. 
Repair DC of 100 to purge a pwned sentry. Chain sentries come with 200 rounds. 
The stats above are for the combined chainguns. They may not be fired 
independently. Turns slowly; to change targets more than 90 degrees takes 2 
actions. Uses visible spectrum target identification.

    Even though Chain sentries fires 8 bullets per action, only two bullets 
every burst proc any per-bullet effects.

== Reverse engineer	==

    "um... sir, should you be... are you cleared to have that?" Won't detonate 
if shot. Even with plasma. And, boy does this sucker pack a punch. DC of 30 to 
hack it and set it off early. Setting one gives you a remote that can easily be 
held in an off hand, even if using a 2 handed weapon. If a teammate detonates 
the ANFO, the engineer that set it gains 10 Energy. Anyone within 9m radius of 
the blast gets an "ears are ringing" status effect which gives a -90% to 
perception checks based on sound for three turns. Remote ANFO comes in a sticky 
bundle and will cling to any shaped hard surface. It will even cling to the

    You set up a local shield generator that creates a 4m radius dome
shield that nobody can shoot through, but anyone can walk through or melee
through. The shield will stop 120 damage per turn or one vehicle damage
before popping. Once a shield has popped, it will need to be repaired at a cost
of 20 Energy and 2 actions. Cannot be repaired more than twice.


== Entrench	== 
Type:			Structure
Build Cost:		40 Energy and 10 Material
Build Time:		8 Actions

Health:			4 Vehicle Health
Size:			Various

    	Perhaps one of your most useful talents is being able to 
quickly cobble together good cover from whatever is lying about and what
you brought in your pack. Sometimes this means ripping up the floor, digging
into the ground to make a simple pillbox, sometimes this means bolting some
ceramic plates onto that coffee table over there and setting it where you
need it to be. However you pull it off, you manage to create a 2m x 2m area
of good cover for 360 degrees. 

== Spotter	==

Disrupt DC:		30
Pwn DC:			70

    	You create a specialized drone that will only follow a Marksman
who is friendly. The spotter takes its turn with that marksman, and takes 
orders from that marksman. It comes equipped with night vision, thermal imaging,
advanced audio sensor arrays and EM spectrum sweepers. It gives audio and visual
cues to what it sees. Unless otherwise specified, it's voice is that of an 
English butler's. It may make up to 3 perception checks per turn using the 
Marksman's perception modifier (since they are working as a team) at a bonus of
20 points. It does not need to roll perception to detect cloaked characters 
within 20m, since they show up like lit Christmas trees on the EM sweepers. In 
an emergency, the spotter may move up to 12m and self-destruct on a close-range
target, dealing 30 damage and emitting a flash similar to a flashbang. Spotters
cannot leave their marksman, and do not occupy a control point. Unlike many 
similar models, the spotter drone is quite stealthy.

    You didn't exactly understand what your Priest was saying about what was in 
this thing, but you could tell he was quite excited. Something about hexadecimal 
core processor, radio and wireless peripherals, embedded botnet, altera SHIELD 
encryption accelerator, digital signal processor, signal triangulator and all 
wrapped up with a web application firewall. Allows any Priest within 8m of the 
station to make wireless hacking checks with a +20 to rolls. Gives friendly 
drones in range a +10 to resist being hacked. Also provides four friendly 
network nodes, all isolated by separate firewalls. The engineer who deployed 
this gets 10 Energy for each system disrupted and 20 Energy for each system 
pwned using this antennae.

    "I uh... haven't figured out how to fit the cartridge into a magazine 
without it ... you know... exploding. But what's in it should work just fine." 
You hand an allied gunslinger a little sidearm that has been your pet project 
for a while. Ignores shields. After every shot, the player who fired it rolls 
luck. If they roll over 80 (modified), all enemies who took damage have their 
shields wink out due to EMP. If they roll under 10, their shields and any nearby 
allies within 5m of them lose their shields due to EMP. Does not effect the 
function of drones or robots. Every enemy hit with the noisy cricket gives 30 
Energy to the engineer who built it.

Type:			Drone
Build Cost:		40 Energy and 15 Material
Build Time:		2 Actions
Duration:		Permanent
Health:			20 Points
Size:			.5m x .5m x .3m

    You create a small flying drone that follows one particular ally (not you). 
The drone carries an adaptive resonator and Nanite shield inductor that 
overcharges your teammate's shields to 40 points above their usual max. It also 
heals any damage to your teammate's shields by 20 points at the end of your 
teammate's turn every turn. It's not really quiet though, so the teammate that 
the drone is following cannot score stealth rolls above 70. For every 20 points 
(including the first 40 of over-heal) of shield strength that the drone heals, 
the engineer who built it gets 15 Energy in return.

    You construct a quadrupedal drone and upload the canine AI to it's 
processor. You imprint your team's hunter upon it. The pointer comes 
prefabricated with a head-mounted 12-gauge peripheral with 10 shots. It also has 
a "point" behavior which it uses to highlight targets for its master. The hunter 
who owns the pointer gets -2 to miss a highlighted target. A pointer cannot 
fire while pointing. Pointers are not quiet and cap stealth scores at 80.

== Medic Drone	==

    You set up and deploy a MD-413 surgical assistant hover drone. It follows 
one particular medic and speeds up all Hippocratic procedures to 1 action (no 
effect if an action would be just one action or faster anyway). It also adds a 
+15 to medical skill checks and adds a +15 to perception checks made by that 
medic. The medic drone does not cost any control points. The engineer who 
deployed the medic drone is able to reclaim 10 Energy every time the medic uses 
the drone to heal something. Medic drones are not quiet and limit a medic to a 
stealth score of 75 while active.

    You assemble a large antimatter slug impeller on the ground and instruct 
your weapons specialist to pick it up and use it until the cannister runs out. 
You explain that he shouldn't drop it, but don't break his brain with the 
physics behind it. The Engineer that deploys this gets 30 Energy per hit with 
this weapon.

== Cloaking Capacitor	== 
Type:			Wearable
Build Cost:		30 Energy and 25 Material
Build Time:		2 Actions
Duration:		Permanent
Health:			40 Points
Size:			.5m x .5m x .3m

    you attach a Nanite capacitor to your teammate's cloaking armor, which 
allows it to maintain a cloak for 2 more turns. The engineer who deploys this 
gets 50 Energy in return. A cloaking capacitor is detectable by detect high 
tech rolls above a 1.

== Defender	== 
Type: 				Drone
Construction Cost:	45 Energy and 45 Material
Control Point Cost: 0 points
Build Time:			6 Actions
Modular I/O ports: 	3 ports
Duration: 			Permanent
Health:				72
Speed:				8m per Action if unladen. 6m per Action if a port contains
a peripheral.
Roaming range:		10m from Assigned Teammate.
Size:				.5m x .1m x .2m
Disrupt DC:			60
Pwn DC:				90

    You set up and deploy a quad rotor flying combat assist drone and task it to 
follow the direction of one of your allies (not you). While unladen, its rotors 
run slightly quieter than most; as long as it isn't carrying anything and its 
ports are unused, it has a maximum stealth check of 90. It runs on a Li+ battery 
and almost never explodes when destroyed. When a drone is reclaimed, it does not 
reimburse its controller's construction materials that were used to assemble it.
