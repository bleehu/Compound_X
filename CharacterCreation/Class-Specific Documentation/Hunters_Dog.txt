Hunter's Dog Rules and Stats
==============================


===== Dog Rules =====

    The Dog cannot use weapons, armor nor non-food items. 

    The Dog is smaller than most combatants and moves very quickly. If the Dog 
has moved at least 8m on their last turn, they are considered to be in partial 
cover from all angles. 

    The Dog has no guard in melee. Instead, up to four times per round the dog 
may roll a reflex save of DC 70 to dodge a melee attack.

    The Dog has a +(level x 4) bonus to Investigation Checks and Awareness Saves 
that their sense of smell can help with. 

    The Dog can use tricks like "lay down," "shake," "fetch," or "chase your 
tail" to charm or distract characters in the area. When they do, the target must
succeed on a Will save opposed by the dog's Performance (Cha) roll.

    The Dog's primary weapon is their bite. Their melee roll is 
6 + (level/4) + roll. On a successful hit, the target is grappled with the Dog
in control, and the target must make a Shock Save of DC 76. If the target 
succeeds on the shock save, they stay standing with the Dog in control of the 
grapple. If they fail the Shock Save, the target is knocked prone also with the
dog in control of the grapple. 
	
	Every time the Dog makes a melee attack while it is in control of a
grapple, it deals 60 damage. Dog attacks usually involve the dog either making
subsequent bites, and/or shaking their head viciously to shred what they're 
currently biting on to ribbons.

===== Notes on Role-Playing A Dog =====

== Projecting ==

In testing, we have found that players who love animals (sometimes beloved 
animals who have passed on) sometimes play a hunter in order to project complex
feelings onto their pretend pet as catharsis. This may lead to unforeseen hurt
feelings if the pretend pet is damaged, killed or is interacted with in an way
that the player didn't expect during role play. It is left as a choice between
the DM and the player if this kind of play is encouraged or discouraged. We do
however strongly recommend having a discussion between the DM and that player 
about cognitive projection prior to playing a Hunter with a dog.
