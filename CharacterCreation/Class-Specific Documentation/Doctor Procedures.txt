==============================
Procedures
==============================
    Doctors have the skills and tools to perform certain Procedures. As a Doctor
gains more experience in the field, they learn to perform new Procedures. 
Procedures are broken into two categories; Malpractice and Hippocratic. 
Hippocratic Procedures help the doctor and their allies. Malpractice Procedures
tend to violate the Hippocratic Oath to "do no harm."

===== Doctor's Procedure Resources =====

Contagions:
    Some of the more ... questionable... talents of the medic require the use of 
mutated pathogens. The doctor's tools can mutate existing biologic material
to produce certain (usually harmful) traits. Contagions are not stored between
conflicts and die at the end of an engagement to prevent the risk of breakout.

Adrenaline:
    Not to be confused with the feat by the same name. As a Medic fights, their
adrenaline levels rise. Some abilities require a certain amount of adrenaline
to perform in combat scenarios. A Doctor cannot have more than 500 
Adrenaline Points at any time. While Doctors are able to calm down between
engagements, they don't ever really relax all the way in a combat zone. 
The net effect is that a Doctor starts every engagement with 100 Adrenaline
Points. 

Needles:
    Some abilities require the expenditure of large, spiky needles. They can
be purchased at most medical centers and some weapons stores.

===== Poisons, Payloads and Deployment Procedures =====

    Some Malpractice Procedures involve the mutation of a Contagion into a 
Poison (sometimes called a Poison Payload or Payload). These Procedures are 
marked on the procedure tree with angled brackets and are listed below as such. 
Poison Procedures can't be used by themselves, but instead make deployment 
Procedures even more dangerous. 
    
    Procedures which use Poison Payloads are denoted on the Procedure Tree with
curl braces. They also say in their effect how they apply a given poison 
payload.

    When using a (poison) payload deployment skill, your chosen poison payload
must be chosen before making your attack roll and must be paid for whether you
hit or not.

==============================
Malpractice Tree
==============================

==Medical Emergency ==
Adrenaline Cost:40 Points
Duration: 	Free Action
Range:		Self
    Increase move speed to 12m per action and get a +30 to acrobatics checks. 
Effect persists for 1 turn. While in a medical emergency, the Doc suffers a +2 
chance to miss, 'cause they have more important things to worry about. Cannot be 
used to move more than 36m per turn.

==Harmacist Spike ==
Adrenaline Cost: 25 Points
Needle Cost:	1 Needle
Duration: 	2 Actions
Range:		40m
    2 chance to miss. Deal 52 damage. AP level 3. If the spike deals damage to 
the target's health and the target is still alive, apply a poison payload of 
your choice. At Player level 5, the Harmacist spike deals 64 damage and has an 
AP level of 4.

==Fast Spike ==
Adrenaline Cost:30 Points
Needle Cost:	1 Needle
Duration: 	1 Action
Range:		40m

your choice.

==Multi Spikes ==
Adrenaline Cost: 40 Points
Needle Cost: 3 Needle
Duration: 	2 Actions
Range:		30m
    You launch off three Harmacist spikes in quick succession using both
hands. Each has a 2 chance to miss. You may pick up to three targets to 
launch at. Each spike that hits deals 52 piercing damage and has an armor piercing 
level of 3. If the needles deal damage to their target's health and the target 
is still alive, apply a poison payload of your choice. Using a payload once 
during this attack applies it to each of the needles. This attack cannot be used
with more than one payload at a time.

==Piercing Spike ==
Adrenaline Cost:35 Points
Needle Cost: 1 Needle
Duration: 	2 Actions
Range:		45m
    2 chance to miss. Deal 42 piercing damage. AP level 5. If the  needle deals 
damage to the target's health and the target is still alive, apply a poison 
payload of your choice. 
    
    At level 10, has AP level 6 instead. At level 15, has AP level 8 and deals 
65 damage. At level 20, ignores physical armor and deals 80 damage.

==Poison: Mild Hallucinogen ==
Adrenaline Cost:20 Points
Contagion Cost: 1 Contagion
Duration: 	5 turns
Range:		Payload (use in combination with other powers)
    Target must pass a DC 70 Will check. If they fail, they suffer one of four 
effects as chosen by GM or by random dice roll listed below. Hallucinogens only 
affects biologic targets.
- Target panics and runs away as fast as he can
- Target believes nearest ally is a vicious, man-eating, submarine-sized, ferret bent on eating his belly button and attacks accordingly
- Target is tricked into thinking he is being eaten alive by bugs and strips naked immediately and attempts to squish them all
- Target discovers that their weapon is actually a sprinkler, and begins watering the grass diligently.

==Poison: Depressant ==
Adrenaline Cost:30 Points
Contagion Cost: 1 Contagion
Duration: 	engagement
Range:		Payload (use in combination with other powers)
    Target must pass a DC 70 Will check. If they fail, target has their speed 
reduced to 25%, round down and takes a +4 to miss. Depressant always deploys as 
an area of effect cloud, even with deployment powers that otherwise wouldn't. 
+5m radius area of effect. Depressant only affects biologic targets. Subsequent
doses of depressant increase the DC by a stacking 10 points each, but the 
negative effects of succumbing to the depressant effect do not stack.

== Contaminate Area ==
Adrenaline Cost: 50 Points
Contagion Cost: 1 Contagion
Duration: 2 Actions
Range: STR m
    The Doctor sprays out a noxious contaminant onto a 2m x 4m rectangle with 
its nearest corner within STR (not strength mod) meters from the Doctor. The 
Doctor must be able to see this area. Biologic targets without gas masks that
are in the affected area when the Doctor sprays it or that end their turn in the
area for 5 turns after it is sprayed must make a FORT save. The FORT save has a
DC of 110. If a target succeeds on the save the area does not affect them and
they do not need to save again if they are still in the area on subsequent 
turns. If they fail the save, they are "contaminated." Races that are extra
sensitive to smoke or disease have disadvantage on this save. At level 10, this
area expands to up to 3m x 5m at the discretion of the Doctor.

    "Contaminated" targets get a -2 to melee or weapon accuracy rolls, and lose
5 health and 5 Nanites at the end of their turn every turn until Contamination
is cured. Contamination can be cured as an action by any character with skill in
medicine such as enemy medics. The effect persists even if the target leaves the
contaminated area. If a target would accrue negative Nanites from this effect,
They take damage equal to the number of negative Nanites and their Nanites stay
at 0. 

    The contaminant spray is a puffy asbestos-pink foam which fades slowly to
gray in color over the 5 turns that it is active. Contaminated targets do not
pass along contamination as in the Plague Procedure and once the foam has faded 
to gray, the contamination has died. However, a character without training in 
medicine might not necessarily know that...

==Poison: Potent Hallucinogen ==
Adrenaline Cost: 50 Points
Contagion Cost: 2 Contagions
Duration: 	10 turns
Range:		Payload (use in combination with other powers)
    Target must pass a DC 150 Will check. If they fail, 
they suffer one of four effects as chosen by the Doc or by random dice roll. 
Hallucinogens only affects biologic targets.
- They are part of the floor.
- They Freak Out.
- They find love.
- They fight the hunger.

    They are part of the floor: The target realizes they are not themselves at 
all, but actually a vital part of the floor. They immediately set everything 
down on themselves and dutifully lay down and become one with the floor. Also, 
they can see music.

    They Freak Out: The target freaks out, and attempts to get his nearest 
compatriot to flee with them. They make a charisma check against their 
compatriot to see if they are successful. Regardless, the target flees for their
life at their speed. 

    They find love: The target realizes that the nearest living thing is their 
soul mate, the love of their life and makes advances according to their custom. 
If the target is alone, the nearest person-sized object will do.

    They fight the hunger: The target realizes that the whole time, they were 
fighting on the wrong side. They immediately join your valiant squad of fighting 
squids in the pursuit of cake. The target has the worst munchies.

==Poison: Fentanyl Derivative ==
Adrenaline Cost: 60 Points
Contagion Cost: 1 Contagion
Duration: 	Engagement
Range:		Payload (use in combination with other powers)
    Target must pass a DC 60 Shock check for every action they take over the 
next 3 turns. If they fail a check, the action they were about to take is 
canceled and they lose that action. If they fail three checks they pass out. If 
they pass out, they must pass a shock check of 120 to wake up. Only works on 
biologic targets.

==Breakout ==
Adrenaline Cost: 60 Points
Duration: 	2 Actions
Range:		15m to 20m radius, with Doc as the center
    Apply a payload of poison of your choosing to every target in range.
Targets with gas masks are immune. Allies are targeted as well.

==Poison: CNS Override ==
Adrenaline Cost: 340 Points
Contagion Cost: 3 Contagions
Duration: 	Engagement
Range:		Payload (use in combination with other powers)
    Target enters a zombie-like state as the modified contagion enter their 
bloodstream and use protein targeting to bind to the target's central nervous 
system. The contagion emulate rare parasites that vary neurotransmitters and
stimulate axion impulses. The end result is that the Doc receives rudimentary
control over the target. Use of CNS Override protocols is experimental, prone
to failure, and very illegal in most sectors. CNS Override only affects 
biologic targets.
    
    The target must pass a Will Save of DC 140 or be brought under the control
of the Doctor. If the target succeeds, they lose two Actions on each of their
next five turns. While under the control of the Doctor, the Doctor may give 
commands of three words or less. Every time the Doctor gives a new command, the 
target may attempt another saving throw. The target is free of the control after
15 turns or two successful saves. Whichever comes first.

==Poison:	PAX ==
Adrenaline Cost: 80 Points
Contagion Cost: 2 Contagions
Duration: 	1 Day
Range:		Payload (use in combination with other powers)
    A target exposed to the PAX strain must pass a DC 240 Will save.
Upon losing the save, the target rolls 1d100 (2d10, one for the 10's place,
one for the 1's place as usual). If the target does not roll a 14, the target
is instantly pacified. A pacified target will not attack anyone or anything
for any reason, even if it has reason to fear for its life. It will comply
with simple commands slowly, as if in a stupor. Prolonged exposure to PAX
will result in targets ceasing to eat, sleep, or move until they starve to
death. 

    In the event that a 14 is rolled, the target reacts badly to the PAX. The 
target will enter an insatiable rage, and will attack the nearest living thing - 
bare handed if need be - with total disregard for the target's safety. A target 
that has reacted badly to PAX will never lie down. It will continue to kill and 
eat any living target until it dies of overconsumption or exhaustion. PAX only 
affects biologic targets.

==Epidemic ==
Adrenaline Cost:80 Points
Duration: 	2 Actions
Range:		30m to 35m radius, with Doc as the center
    Apply a payload of poison of your choosing to every target in range. Targets 
with gas masks are immune. Allies are targeted as well.

==Poison:	NF-34 ==
Adrenaline Cost: 80 Points
Contagion Cost: 1 Contagion
Duration: 	20 turns
Range:		Payload (use in combination with other powers)
    The biologic agent eats away at the target's flesh and biologic parts at an 
astonishing rate. The target takes 3d10 damage per turn for the duration of 
their affliction. They can be cured by decontamination devices or specially 
trained doctors. Targets that are wearing a gas mask, but have any exposed 
biology are affected by this even if a deployment method says they wouldn't. Use
of biologic weapons are severely frowned upon in most civilized regions of space.

==Biopsy ==
Adrenaline Cost: 40 Points
Needle Cost: 1 Needle
Contagion Reward: 4 Contagions
Duration: 1 Action
Range: Touch
    You need more pathogens, but your teammates aren't sharing. Perhaps your 
enemy might be made to donate some? You grab one of your needles and violently 
scoop some out of them. This isn't exactly how it worked in med school. Make a 
melee attack against your enemy. If it hits, you get a contagion reward of 4, if 
it misses, you get nothing. You get a -2 to miss and deal damage equal to 4 * 
Strength. Ignore armor. 

==Poison: Thiopental Derivative ==
Contagion Cost: 1 Contagion
Duration: 	2 Actions
Range:		Payload (use in combination with other powers)
    Truth serum. Principle uses are for non-combat situations. While any 
character could procure similar substances as a role-playing item for about $60 
worth of chemistry supplies and a chemistry check of DC 80 a piece, the value of 
this trick is that it's free, almost unlimited and you don't need to worry about 
smuggling it anywhere.
    
    A biologic target dosed with this substance only gets 3 actions on their 
turn and must pass a Will Save of DC 90 whenever they are asked a question. If
they pass, they may lie. If they fail, they must answer with total candor. 
Targets dosed with the Thiopental Derivative in combat are totally honest about
commiting to shots, and must succeed on the DC 90 will save or they cannot 
hunker or take superior cover. The effect lasts for one out-of-combat 
conversation or 5 turns in combat.

==Transmission Vector ==
Adrenaline Cost:60 Points
Needle Cost: 1 Needle
Duration: 	2 Actions
Range:		5m radius centered at a point up to 30m from the Doc
Effect:		You add an aerator to the end of your needle and launch it not at 
one target in particular, but among the fray hoping to hit multiple targets.
Targets without gas masks have the poison payload of your choice applied to 
them.

==Poison:	NF-40 ==
Adrenaline Cost: 60 Points
Contagion Cost: 1 Contagion
Duration: 	two weeks
Range:		Payload (use in combination with other powers)
    The biologic agent eats away at the target's flesh and biologic parts at an 
astonishing rate. The target takes 20 + 2d10 damage per turn for the duration of 
their affliction. They can be cured by decontamination devices or specially 
trained medics. Targets that are wearing a gas mask, but have any exposed 
biology are affected by this even if a deployment method says they wouldn't. 
Use of biologic weapons are severely frowned upon in most civilized regions of 
space.

==Poison:	Lethal Toxin ==
Adrenaline Cost: 60 Points
Contagion Cost: 1 Contagion
Duration: 	almost instantaneous
Range:		Payload (use in combination with other powers)
    A biologic target afflicted with this poison must succeed on a DC 110 FORT 
save or the target takes 180 damage that ignores shields and armor and Disrupts 
the target for up to 10 turns or a WILL save of DC 92 whichever is first. If the 
target succeeds on their save, they take 60 damage instead. See 
"01_02_conditions.txt" for the Disrupted Condition. At level 13, damage 
increases to 220. Does not prevent unarmed or attacks with guns or melee weapons.

==Plague ==
Adrenaline Cost: 250 Points
Needle Cost: 2 Needles
Duration: 	1 day
Range:		40m
    The target has the poison payload of your choice applied to them. Any time 
another biologic target (friend or foe) comes within 8m of a target infected 
with plague that new target gets infected too. This effect is recursive without 
limit, but a target that has made a save against the payload delivered by this 
procedure is inoculated from subsequent recursions of this procedure. If a 
Poison Payload does not list a Save, use a DC 80 Fortitude save on spreading the
plague. A target which has succeeded on their save or a target that has died is
not contagious anymore.

==Mild Phenethylamine Agonist ==
Adrenaline Cost: 60 Points
Contagion Cost: 1 Contagions
Duration: 1 Action
Range: Applies to the Doc only
    For 3 turns, the doc gets a -3 to miss with guns, grenades, spells, and

==Free Running ==
Adrenaline Cost: 60 Points
Nanite Cost: 15 Nanites
Duration: 	2 Actions
Range:		5m radius centered at a point up to 30m from the Doc
    Your Nanites form microscopic bonds with any solid surface allowing 
movement at your speed along any flat, solid surface that can support your 
weight. The procedure for doing this without blowing up one's heart or leaving
one's spine behind takes more training than the average soldier receives. It 
also can be quite exhausting.

==Dex-10 ==
Adrenaline Cost: 60 Points
Contagion Cost: 1 Contagion
Duration: 	1 action
Range:		Doc only
    Your move speed increases by 4m per 2 Actions, with an absolute maximum of

Range:		Effects apply only to the Doc
    This is a fully customized brew specially grown to bond with your
personal biochemistry. The effect lasts for 8 turns. You gain:

foreign substances in their system. Any malicious Nanites or poisons or toxins 
or parasites are immediately expelled as they violently puke. This cancels the 
effect of domination, any NF variants, poison, hallucinogens, ongoing internal 
burns, depressants, and paralytics other than physical impact. This procedure 
only works on biologic targets.

==Mild Analgesic ==
Adrenaline Reward:	10 Points
Range:			Touch
Action:			1 Action
    You shoot your ally with a mild pain reliever, not enough to make them 
really happy or cloud their mind, but enough to help them work through the pain 
of a decent injury. For 5 turns, your ally gets 30 temporary health. This 
procedure only works on biologic patients. You may not give a patient more than 
one dose of analgesic per engagement, lest they suffer dire side effects like 
irrational happiness, lack of focus, addiction and cardiac arrest.

Contagion Reward : 1 Contagion
Needle Cost: 1 Needle
Range:			Touch
Action:			1 Action
    The ECSC really shouldn't find out that you've been stocking up on this 
stuff. You mentally rationalize your decision to inject your ally with it as you 
slide the needle between their armor plates. Your ally gains 100 temporary 
health, but at the cost of -2 temporary perception and intelligence. This 
procedure only works on biologic patients. You may use this power more than once 
on a patient during an engagement, but after the first dose, the negative side 
effects persist for the rest of the engagement and stack. If at any point during 
the engagement, perception drops below 1, the patient will go blind or deaf or 
both at the GM's discretion. If Intelligence drops below 1 at any time during 
the engagement, the patient suffers brain death.
