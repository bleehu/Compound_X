    You use your biofoam applicator to spray the smelly green foam into their
wounds. The miracle of modern science rapidly reconnects arteries and veins and
begins to mimic destroyed organs and muscle tissue. It hurts like hell, but it
will give them a chance to keep it together long enough to get a more permanent
solution back at base. 

    You must have your Field Applicator drawn in order to use this ability. Your
patient heals an ammount of health listed on the table below. As your character
learns more medicine skill, the better they heal. Unless otherwise stated, this
ability cannot heal a patient above half health.

+-----------------+--------------+--------+

==Defib ==
Adrenaline Reward:  80 Points
Contagion Reward: 2 Contagion
Range: Touch
Action: 2 Actions

    You adjust the dials on your biofoam injector to compensate for loss of
vital fluids and to administer the correct frequency and wattage of tachycardia
interuptor shock. This is gonna hurt like hell, but they'll live to complain 
about it at least. Who knows? Maybe they'll even say "Thank you!" this time?

    You must have your Field Applicator drawn in order to use this ability. Only 
usable on an biological patient that is bleeding out. The target is no longer 
downed and gains 10+2d10 Health Points, rather than having to stabilize the target 
and then heal them as a separate action.

== Pre-op triage ==
Adrenaline Reward:  30 Points
Contagion Reward: 1 Contagion
Range: 10m
Action: 1 Action

    You scan the patient and dial your Field Applicator to match the patient's
unique biochemestry. You also take the time to more closely inspect the patient's
injuries and extrapolate the battlefield's effect on their condition. Your
keen eye and experience allows you to better treat your patient's maladies. 

    You must have your Field Applicator drawn in order to use this ability. This 
procedure only works on biologic patients. If you use another procedure on this 
patient either this turn or the next turn that says you can only heal them up
to half health, you may ignore that limitation.

==Remote Surgery ==
Adrenaline Reward:  20
Range:          20m
Action:         2 Actions

    Let's take this show on the road! You carefully feed out an omni-glob from
your trusty applicator and throw it at your distant patient. Then, turning to
your applicator, direct its functions from afar. 

    You must have your Field Applicator drawn in order to use this ability, and 
you must be able to see your patient. Your patient heals an ammount of health 
listed on the table below. As your character learns more medicine skill, the 
better they heal. Unless otherwise stated, this ability cannot heal a patient 
above half health.

You give your ally a quick shot of stuff that makes their system reject any 
foreign substances in their system. Any malicious Nanites or poisons or toxins

of a decent injury. For 5 Rounds, your ally gets 30 temporary health. This 
procedure only works on biologic patients. You may not give a patient more than 
one dose of analgesic per engagement, lest they suffer dire side effects like 
irrational happiness, lack of focus, addiction and cardiac arrest.

Needle Cost: 1 Needle
Range:          Touch
Action:         1 Action
    The ECSC really shouldn't find out that you've been stocking up on this 
stuff. You mentally rationalize your decision to inject your ally with it as you 
slide the needle between their armor plates. Your ally gains 100 temporary 
health, but at the cost of -2 temporary perception and intelligence. This 
procedure only works on biologic patients. You may use this power more than once 
on a patient during an engagement, but after the first dose, the negative side 
effects persist for the rest of the engagement and stack. If at any point during 
the engagement, perception drops below 1, the patient will go blind or deaf or 
both at the GM's discretion. If Intelligence drops below 1 at any time during 
the engagement, the patient suffers brain death.
