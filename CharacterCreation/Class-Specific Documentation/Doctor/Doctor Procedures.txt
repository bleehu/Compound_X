Procedures
==============================
    Doctors have the skills and tools to perform certain Procedures. As a Doctor
gains more experience in the field, they learn to perform new Procedures. 
Procedures are broken into two categories; Malpractice and Hippocratic. 
Hippocratic Procedures help the doctor and their allies. Malpractice Procedures
tend to violate the Hippocratic Oath to "do no harm."

===== Doctor's Procedure Resources =====

Contagions:
    Some of the more ... questionable... talents of the medic require the use of 
mutated pathogens. The doctor's tools can mutate existing biologic material
to produce certain (usually harmful) traits. Contagions are not stored between
conflicts and die at the end of an engagement to prevent the risk of breakout.

Adrenaline:
    Not to be confused with the feat by the same name. As a Medic fights, their
adrenaline levels rise. Some abilities require a certain amount of adrenaline
to perform in combat scenarios. A Doctor cannot have more than 500 
Adrenaline Points at any time. While Doctors are able to calm down between
engagements, they don't ever really relax all the way in a combat zone. 
The net effect is that a Doctor starts every engagement with 100 Adrenaline
Points. 

Needles:
    Some abilities require the expenditure of large, spiky needles. They can
be purchased at most medical centers and some weapons stores.

===== Poisons, Payloads and Deployment Procedures =====

    Some Malpractice Procedures involve the mutation of a Contagion into a 
Poison (sometimes called a Poison Payload or Payload). These Procedures are 
marked on the procedure tree with angled brackets and are listed below as such. 
Poison Procedures can't be used by themselves, but instead make deployment 
Procedures even more dangerous. 
    
    Procedures which use Poison Payloads are denoted on the Procedure Tree with
curl braces. They also say in their effect how they apply a given poison 
payload.

    When using a (poison) payload deployment skill, your chosen poison payload
must be chosen before making your attack roll and must be paid for whether you
hit or not.
