Priest Hacking Abilities
==============================

Systems in compound X are built up of many different nodes representing 
functions within the system. There might be a node for a single door control, 
or there might be a node representing an electronic light switch. There are 
four categories that these nodes can fall into:
    - Blockers: Mainly Firewalls, but other systems can impede access to parts 
      of the network. Crypto-systems would be an example of a blocker node 
      within an information network.
    - Interactables: Correspond to some action in the real-world. Light 
      operation, door controls, etc.
    - Information: Mainly file systems / PCs, but could include other things.
    - Traps: appear to be one or another type of node. Have negative affects 
      on a priest who attempts to attack or probe them if they don't detect 
      and then disarm the trap.
Basic hackers can interract with nodes in three ways, and also perform various 
skill checks while analyzing a system:
    - Attack: Allows access to the next set of nodes in the system (depending 
      on the architecture some regions can be compartmentalized to discourage 
      enemy hackers gaining full control of the network); or allows hacker to
      take control of that node.
    - Probe: reveals what nodes are beyond the probed node without controlling 
      the node or activating any nodes beyond it. Sort of like peeking through 
      a keyhole, you can see whats beyond the door without anything in the 
      room beyond knowing you're looking. Of course, if you think you're 
      looking through a keyhole, but its really the fly on a cleverly 
      disguised guard, you're in for some trouble. Traps can look like any 
      other node, so be careful when probing a firewall.
    - Monitor: Any time the node in question is used, the one monitoring is 
      notified. The hacker monitoring the node can also see traffic going 
      through a node and choose to intercept the trafic if they wish. Probing 
      and attacking a node alert someone monitoring it. Firewalls are 
      generally monitored, although with high enough skill, or a lucky roll, a 
      hacker can enter a system without alerting someone monitoring the 
      firewall. (injection technique).
There are other ways of interacting with nodes. Priests can create software 
nodes to set traps or monitor a line. There are also other ablities available 
to higher level Priests.

Robotic units can also be hacked. When expecting an attack the DC is much 
higher. Hacked robots can be manipulated in a few ways: (in order of difficulty)
    - Halt Action
    - deactivate
    - Take cover
    - Leave cover
    - Move
    - Fire

Example Network: A simple couple room listening post with a single computer.

[B]F1:60 {
    [I]D1:60 main door
    [B]F2:80{
        [N]S1: hard-drive with some info, no encryption.
        [N]R1: communication client
    }
    [I]L1:20 entry room light
    [I]D2:45 store-room door
    [I]L2:20 store-room light
}

===== Ability List =====
Abilities might be listed as the following:
Name[Spot DC / Disarm DC]: description with effects, other DCs.
The user must roll above the Disarm DC to set up a trap node.

Level 1:

Level 3:
    Injection Technique:
        Allows entry to a firewalled system without alerting anyone monitoring 
        the firewall. You may probe or attack a node once without alerting 
        anyone watching it. If you fail and need to attack again, you still 
        run the risk of being found out.
Level 7:
    Create Node, Lesser:
        User may create at their discretion any of the following nodes:
        Trap nodes:
            Malware, worm[45 / 20]: when the attacker activates this node, a 
            benign worm infects their system, hogging system resources. Target 
            takes a -20 penalty to hacking checks for 4 turns.

            Malware, scarecrow[55 / 10]: appears as a user machine connected 
            to the network. when attacked, it simply dissappears and 
            reappears. DC 55 INT check to realize that this is not a real user.

            Malware, ad-bomb[60 / 50]: dozens of ads are launched on the target
            's device, most of which are very loud and possibly quite lewd in 
            nature. Target device is disabled for 1 turn.
        Firewall, lesser[50]: Generates a DC 50 firewall under any node the 
        user controls.
Level 11:
    Create Node:
        Traps:
            Malware, centipede[75 / 40]: when attacked, this malicious worm 
            begins deleting system files from the attacker's device. Target 
            takes a -20 penalty to hacking checks until a DC 90 is passed. If 
            this DC is not met within 4 turns, the centipede eats through 
            enough system files to force a reboot that disables the target's 
            device for 1 turn.

            Malware, augment: Increase the disarm and spot DCs of a lesser 
            malware by 20 each.
        Firewall [70]
        Encrypt [50] Opponents cannot probe past this node. Place it under any 
        node you control.
Level 13:
    iCAN: 
		internal Computer Assisted Networking. Not everyone has a server 
		farm or bot-net available to do their bidding. Increase your hack score by 
		5 for each Information Node you control on a network. Robotic units count 
		towards this buff.
Level 16:
    Create Node, Greater
Level 18:
    Unique ability
