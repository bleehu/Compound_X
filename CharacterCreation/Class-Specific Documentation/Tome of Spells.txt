 * Tome of Spells
 * For a 1 action spell to be cast, the caster must pass a DC equal to the 
 * Nanites spent on the spell, max 100. For paladins, the DC is instead 5* the 
 * favor cost of the spell. For example, Sword of Righteousness has a Cast DC 
 * of 60 (5 * 12 favor). The DC must be passed before any nanites are spent, 
 * so if the DC is failed, no Nanites are lost.
