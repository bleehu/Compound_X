==============================
Procedures
==============================
Medics have the skills and tools to perform certain procedures.

Contagions:
Some of the more ... questionable... talents of the medic require the use of 
mutated pathogens. The medic's tools can mutate existing biologic material
to produce certain (usually harmful) traits. Contagions are not stored between
conflicts and die at the end of an engagement.

Adrenaline:
Not to be confused with the feat by the same name. As a Medic fights, their
adrenaline levels rise. Some abilities require a certain amount of adrenaline
to perform in combat scenarios. A medic cannot have more than 500 
adrenaline points at any time. While medics are able to calm down between
engagements, they don't ever really relax all the way in a combat zone. 
The net effect is that a medic starts every engagement with 100 adrenaline
points. 

Needles:
Some abilities require the expenditure of large, spiky needles. They can
be purchased at most medical centers and some weapons stores.

with them. They make a charisma check against their compatriot to see if 
they are successful. Regardless, the target flees.
- The target realizes that the nearest living thing is their soul mate, the
love of their life and makes advances according to their custom. If the 
target is alone, the nearest person-sized object will do.
- The target realizes that the whole time, they were fighting on the wrong
side. They immediately join your valiant squad of fighting squids in the 
pursuit of cake. The target has the worst munchies.
Hallucinogens only affects biologic targets.

----Poison: Fentanyl Derivative	-----
Adrenaline Cost: 60
Contagion Cost: 1
Duration: 	engagement
Range:		Payload (use in combination with other powers)
Effect:		Target must pass a DC 60 Shock check for every action they take over
the next 3 turns. If they fail a check, the action they were about to take is
canceled and they lose that action. If they fail three checks they pass out. 
if they pass out, they must pass a shock check of 120 to wake up. Only works
on biologic targets.

----Breakout	-----
Adrenaline Cost: 60
Duration: 	2 Actions
Range:		15m to 20m radius, with Doc as the center
Effect:		Apply a payload of poison of your choosing to every target in range.
Targets with gas masks are immune. Allies are targeted as well.

----Poison: CNS Override	-----
Adrenaline Cost: 340
Contagion Cost: 3
Duration: 	engagement
Range:		Payload (use in combination with other powers)
Effect:		Target enters a zombie-like state as the modified contagion enter their 
bloodstream and use protien targeting to bind to the target's central nervous 
system. The contagion emulate rare parisites that vary neurotransmitters and
stimulate axion impulses. The end result is that the Doc receives rudimentary
control over the target. Use of CNS Override protocols is experimental, prone
to failure, and very illegal in most sectors. CNS Override only affects 
biologic targets.

----Poison:	PAX	-----
Adrenaline Cost: 80
Contagion Cost: 2
Duration: 	1 Day
Range:		Payload (use in combination with other powers)
Effect:		A target exposed to the PAX strain must pass a DC 240 Will save.
Upon losing the save, the target rolls 1d100 (2d10, one for the 10's place,
one for the 1's place as usual). If the target does not roll a 14, the target
is instantly pacified. A pacified target will not attack anyone or anything
for any reason, even if it has reason to fear for its life. It will comply
with simple commands slowly, as if in a stupor. Prolonged exposure to PAX
will result in targets ceasing to eat, sleep, or move until they starve to
death. In the event that a 14 is rolled, the target reacts badly to the PAX.
The target will enter an insatiable rage, and will attack the nearest living
thing - bare handed if need be - with total disregard for the target's safety.
A target that has reacted badly to PAX will never lie down. It will continue
to kill and eat any living target until it dies of overconsumption or exhaustion.
PAX only affects biologic targets.

----Epidemic	-----
Adrenaline Cost:80
Duration: 	2 Actions
Range:		30m to 35m radius, with Doc as the center

Effect:		The biologic agent eats away at the target's flesh and biologic 
parts at an astonishing rate. The target takes 3d10 damage per turn for the 
duration of their affliction. They can be cured by decontamination devices or 
specially trained medics. Targets that are wearing a gas mask, but have any 
exposed biology are affected by this even if a deployment method says they 
wouldn't. Use of biologic weapons are severely frowned upon in most civilized 
regions of space.

----Biopsy	-----
Adrenaline Cost: 40
Needle Cost:		1
Contagion Reward: 4
Duration: 1 Action
Range: Touch
Effect: You need more pathogens, but your teammates aren't sharing. Perhaps

violently scoop some out of them. This isn't exactly how it worked in med school.
Make a melee attack against your enemy. If it hits, you get a contagion reward
of 4, if it misses, you get nothing. You get a -20% to miss and deal damage 
equal to 4 * Strength. Ignore armor. 

----Poison: Thiopental Derivative	-----
Contagion Cost: 1
Duration: 	2 Actions
Range:		Payload (use in combination with other powers)
Effect:		Truth serum. Principle uses are for non-combat situations. While any 
character could procure similar substances as a role-playing item for about $60 
worth of chemistry supplies and a chemistry check of DC 80 a piece, the value of 
this trick is that it's free, almost unlimited and you don't need to worry about 
smuggling it anywhere.

Duration: 	2 Actions

Contagion Cost: 1
Duration: 	two weeks

parts at an astonishing rate. The target takes 20 + 2d10 damage per turn for the
duration of their affliction. They can be cured by decontamination devices

wouldn't. Use of biologic weapons are severely frowned upon in most civilized 
regions of space.

Adrenaline Cost: 60
Contagion Cost: 1
Duration: 	almost instantaneous
