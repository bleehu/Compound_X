Gravity Technician Abilities
==============================

A Note on Terminology:
	Where used in this class's documentation, the word "massive" is 
not meant to imply largeness or heaviness. It means only that the 
referenced object has mass, and is thus affected by gravity.

== Gravity Technique General Notes ==

	Gravity Projectors have a maximum range at which they can exert 
noticeable force. When using a Technique with Weapon range, the Technician 
may set the maximum range of effect any distance equal or lesser than the 
given value. Any effects that take place at fractional range, such as the 
effects of Impeller Field, are determined based on the maximum range used, 
not the maximum range possible.

	Some techniques have Personal range, which means that they only 
apply effects within the user's square except as otherwise stated.

	Techniques that require Channeling take 2 Actions to activate and 
cost 2 Actions each subsequent turn that the ability is maintained. The 
user may move and take other Actions while channeling, but cannot use 
other Techniques and must maintain control of their gravity projector. A 
GravTech who takes more than 80 damage in an Action must make a Will save 
with DC equal to half the damage taken to maintain the technique; on failure 
the channel stops. The user may stop the channel any time on their turn 
as a Free Action.

	For Techniques that allow targets to make a Save to mitigate 
effects, the base DC is given by the Gravity Projector and may be modified 
by microassembly cores or peripherals.

	Gravitic effects and attacks are not blocked by cover unless the 
cover specifically states otherwise. Targets of Beam-shaped gravity techniques 
benefit from being harder to aim at: Partial cover grants +10 to saves while 
total obscurement grants advantage on saves. This does not apply to techniques 
using Conical or Radial fields.

===== Gravity Techniques =====

== Impeller Field ==

Prerequisites: None

Graviton Cost: 20
Duration: Channel - 10 Gravitons/Round
Range: Standard
Save: Shock
Field Shapes: Sphere, Hemisphere, Cone, Ring, Sector

	Creates a field of steady gravity, increasing the move speed 
of objects or characters moving toward the source and decreasing the move 
speed of objects or characters moving away from the source. Does not 
affect movement that is neither toward or away from the source. Reevaluate 
effects on moving objects or characters each Action. Unwilling subjects 
that pass the save are unaffected for 10 Rounds, or 1 minute.
	
Within one quarter range: ± 2 Move Speed
Within one half range: ± 1 Move Speed
Within full range: ± 1/2 Move Speed

== Accelerator Field ==

Prerequisites: Impeller Field

Graviton Cost: 40
Duration: Channel - 15 Gravitons / Round
Range: Standard
Save: Shock
Field Shapes: Sphere, Hemisphere, Cone, Ring, Sector

	Description

== Pull ==

Prerequisites: None

Graviton Cost: 15
Duration: Channel - 5 Gravitons/Round
Range: Standard
Save: Shock
Field Shapes: Beam, Cone

	By focusing gravity on a massive target, the technician forces it to 
move towards the gravity source. A successful save negates the effect. Failure 
forces movement according to the list below and prevents other unassisted 
movement. Subjects must roll the save each Round, at the start of their turn.

Within one quarter range: 4m/Round
Within one half range: 2m/Round
Within full range: 1m/Round

== Pluck ==

Prerequisites: Pull

Graviton Cost: 30
Duration: 2 Actions
Range: Standard
Save: Reflex
Field Shapes: Beam

	Fine control of the Pull Technique allows a technician to target 
carried items. Using this Technique initiates a Disarm attempt in which 
the Technician uses their Knowledge - High Tech (Dex) skill instead of 
a Maneuver Check.

== Tidal Shear ==

Prerequisites: None

Graviton Cost: 35
Duration: 2 Actions
Range: Standard
Save: See below
Field Shapes: Beam, Ring, Sector

	The emission of rapidly changing gravity in a flat shape subjects those 
in its area to a damaging shear effect. Affected characters take 70 Internal 
damage. This attack bypasses normal armor entirely. A successful Shock save or a 
successful Reflex save at half DC halves the damage.

== Catch Field ==

Prerequisites: None

Graviton Cost: 25
Duration: Channel - 10 Gravitons/Round
Range: Personal
Save: Reflex
Field Shapes: Sphere

	The technician projects a short-range but powerful gravity field capable 
of catching small projectiles (eg. bullets, plasma bottles, or throwing knives, 
but nothing heavier) and holding them in an orbit. This Catch Field will capture 
any such projectile that passes through the source's space without dealing damage 
to the source or its wielder (including those shot by allies). Users should track 
the number of projectiles captured by the field. At the beginning of the 
Technician's turn, if a loaded catch field is adjacent to an enemy, the field 
loses one projectile and deals 40 damage to up to three enemies. A successful 
save halves the damage.

== Gravity Sling ==

Prerequisites: None

Graviton Cost: 25
Duration: 2 Actions
Range: Standard
Save: Reflex
Field Shapes: Sphere

	The technician uses a powerful but personal-range field to fling a small, 
massive object. Using this technique, a technician may launch an object as heavy 
or lighter than a hand grenade up to standard range (must still roll Accuracy as 
normal).

	Alternatively, this technique may be used while the source is emitting a 
loaded Catch Field. This terminates the Catch Field to launch all of the orbiting 
projectiles at a single target within standard range. This attack does 20 Ballistic 
damage per captured projectile, damaging armor if applicable. A successful save 
halves the damage.

== Driving Field ==

Prerequisites: Accelerator Field, Level 6

Graviton Cost: 
Duration: Channel - 
Range: Standard
Save: Shock
Field Shapes: Sphere, Hemisphere, Cone, Ring, Sector

	Description

== Pull Pulse ==

Prerequisites: Level 6

Graviton Cost: 45 Gravitons
Duration: 2 Actions
Range: Standard
Save: Shock
Field Shapes: Sphere, Hemisphere, Cone, Ring, Sector

	The technician uses a short pulse of intense but steady gravity in a 
wide shape, forcing movement toward the source and applying the Prone state. 
A successful save negates these effects.

Within one quarter range: 20m
Within one half range: 10m
Within full range: 5m

== Pull Pulse II ==

Prerequisites: Pull Pulse

Graviton Cost: 
Duration: 2 Actions
Range: Standard

	Description

== Gravity Spike ==

Prerequisites: Level 6

Graviton Cost: 35
Duration: 2 Actions
Range: Standard
Save: See below
Field Shapes: Beam

	A very short pulse of instense gravity causes disarrangement of the 
target's internals. Affected characters take 70 Internal damage. This attack 
bypasses normal armor entirely. A successful Reflex save or a successful Shock 
save at half DC halves the damage.

== Absorption Field ==

Prerequisites: Catch Field, Level 6

Graviton Cost: 
Duration: Channel - 
Range: Personal
Save: Reflex
Field Shapes: Sphere

	Description

== Extended Absorption ==

Prerequisites: Absorption Field

Prerequisites: Gravity Sling, Level 6

Graviton Cost: 
Duration: 2 Actions
Range: Standard
Save: Reflex
Field Shapes: Sphere

	Description

== Sequential Launch ==

Prerequisites: Gravity Launch

	Allows projectiles launched by Gravity Sling or Gravity Launch to use other 
controlled gravity wells to execute gravity slingshot maneuvers as long as their 
trajectory is deflected by at leat 90 degrees.

== Gravity Bolt ==

Prerequisites: Gravity Spike, Level 11

Graviton Cost:

== Disorientation ==

Prerequisites: Level 11

Graviton Cost: 25
Duration: Channel - 20 Gravitons/Round
Range: Standard
Save: Shock
Field Shapes: Sphere, Hemisphere, Ring

	The technician creates an unsteady field of light gravity, disorienting 
those within. Characters within range suffer -1 to all Accuracy rolls and have 
Disadvantage on Reflex Saves. A successful save negates this effect. Affected 
characters must roll the save every Round, at the beginning of their turns.

== Resonance ==

Prerequisites: Disorientation

	Penalties from Disorientation and Vertigo stack on targets for each 
overlapping generator field.

== Rappel ==

Prerequisites: Level 11

Graviton Cost: 25
Duration: Channel - 15 Gravitons/Round
Range: Standard
Save: N/A
Field Shapes: Beam

	Fine manipulation of a steady gravity stream allows the Technician to 
gravitivally anchor themselves to a stable surface within range, allowing 
climbing and rappelling along surfaces. The technician moves at their normal 
Move Speed while using this technique and makes Knowledge - High Tech (Int) 
checks in place of Athletics checks where appropriate.

	Targets caught in at least three Pull techniques from different 
generators you control, and which have failed at least three Saves, become 
unable to move and are considered Helpless unless they succeed on an 
additional Shock save. If a target succeeds this Save they cannot be 
subjected to Stasis for 1 day. The generators must describe an arc of at 
least 180 degrees to attempt Stasis.

===== Field Shapes =====

	Each Technique lists the shapes with which it can be used. If an 
advanced shape's name includes the name of a basic shape, it is considered 
to be that shape for this purpose.

== Sphere ==

Prerequisite: None
Type: Radial

	The sphere shape affects all massive objects within range in every 
direction.

== Hemisphere ==

Prerequisite: Sphere
Type: Radial

	The hemisphere shape affects all massive objects within range that are 
within 90 degrees of the declared direction.

== Beam ==

Prerequisite: Sphere
Type: Beam

	The beam shape affects all massive objects in a line up to the 
Technique's range in length. If the line passes through opposite sides 
of a square, it affects objects in that square.

== Cone ==

Prerequisite: Hemisphere
Type: Conical

	The cone shape affects all massive objects within range that are within 
a 45 degree cone.

== Ring ==

Prerequisites: Sphere
Type: Radial

	The ring shape affects all massive objects within range that occupy the 
same plane.

== Sector ==

Prerequisite: Ring
Type: Conical

	The sector shape affects all massive objects within range that occupy the 
same plane and are within a 45 degree sector. A sector is a two-dimensional cone.

== (Adv) Double Beam ==

Prerequisite: Beam
Type: Beam

	This advanced shape projects two Beams simultaneously. The beams must 
be within 45 degrees of each other or exactly 180 degrees apart. Using this 
shape reduces the maximum range of a Technique by half.

== (Adv) Multibeam ==

Prerequisite: Double Beam, Level 16
Type: Beam

	This advanced shape projects arbitrarily many Beams, but any Technique 
using this shape requires an additional Action of preparation to use. Using two 
beams reduces the maximum range by half, and each additional beam reduces the 
range by a further 5 meters.

== (Adv) Double Ring ==

Prerequisite: Ring
Type: Radial

	This advanced shape projects two perpendicular rings. Anything caught in a 
suqare where the two Rings intersect takes 50% more damage from a damaging technique, 
and any Save DC from the used Technique is increased by 50%.

== (Adv) Triple Ring ==

Prerequisite: Double Ring, Level 16
Type: Radial

	This advanced shape projects three perpendicular rings. Anything caught in a 
suqare where two Rings intersect takes 50% more damage from a damaging technique, 
and any Save DC from the used Technique is increased by 50%.

== (Adv) Cross Sector ==

Prerequisite: Sector
Type: Conical

	This advanced shape projects two perpendicular sectors that intersect each 
other's centers. Anything caught in a suqare where the two Sectors intersect takes 
50% more damage from a damaging technique, and any Save DC from the used Technique 
is increased by 50%.
