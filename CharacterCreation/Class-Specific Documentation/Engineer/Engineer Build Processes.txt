==============================
Build Processes
==============================

    The build processes that an Engineer employs allow them to be constructed
quickly in the field using the Engineer's multipurpose extruder tool. If an
Engineer's multipurpose extruder tool is lost, broken or confiscated, they 
cannot perform most of their build Processes. Unlocking a Build tree skill 
requires having unlocked the skill below it on the tree. Please see the Engineer 
Skill Tree - Build.png for dependencies.


Drones:

    Some processes let an Engineer construct Drones. Drones do not count as 
"cybernetic allies" for most repair skills, though you can repair them with 
repair kits as normal. They take their turns independently, with 4 actions per 
turn, and they take their owner's (not necessarily their deployer's) initiative. 
A Drone can only use 4 IO ports at a time unless otherwise stated. 

    Some Drones are able to make melee attacks. These drones do not have a DEX
Modifier or other melee skills; all of their bonus to hit is included in their
Accuracy Modifier. 

IO Ports:

    Most Drones (and a couple of static buildings) will have IO ports. Think of
IO Ports as slots that you can add things to upgrade your Drone or Building.
These upgrades are called Peripherals. If a drone doesn't have an empty IO Port
left, then you cannot add another Peripheral to that Drone. Drones cannot 
dynamically allocate IO ports between more than their capacity. Another way of
saying this is that if a Drone has 3 IO Ports, you can't build 4 Peripherals
onto it and have the Drone turn peripherals off or on as it wants to; every
Peripheral must have an active IO Port or it simply falls off of the Drone. 

    IO Ports are a real-world Computer/Electric Engineering term which is short
for Input/Output Ports.

    The dragonfly is a small, light, fast flying drone that stays close
to its deployer. Unlike most drones, it cannot use external network motes to 
increase its range.  It's onboard sensor network gives it's deployer a +6 to 
perception rolls. It's landing gear can also grasp and carry objects weighing
less than 8kg. Powered by a Li+ battery, will almost never explode when 
destroyed. Due to it's not-quite-quiet rotors, limits deployer's stealth scores
to a maximum of 75. If the deployer moves outside of its 6m service range, the
dragonfly will passively move to the nearest point to it that is in range. Due 
to its small size and jerky flight movement, a Dragonfly that moved in the same 
Round that it is shot at adds a +3 chance for the attacker to miss.

    When a drone is reclaimed, it frees up the control point cost that it 
occupied, but does not reimburse its construction cost.

            The KRO-W5 or "Crow" is a lightweight quad-rotor drone 
designed for low-altitude operation. Combining agility with modularity. Its
onboard targeting laser gives the ally nearest to it a +2 bonus to accuracy 
against the nearest enemy that it has line of sight to. It also has a redundant
kernel checksum system to make hacking it more difficult. While unladen, its
rotors run slightly quieter than most; as long as it isn't carrying anything 
and its ports are unused, it has a maximum stealth check of 90. It runs on a
Li+ battery and almost never explodes when destroyed. The Crow doesn't come
with landing gear typically, so to get it to carry something other than a 
peripheral an engineer would have to jerry rig something on to it. See GM for 
Role Playing options.

    This small bipedal drone comes equipped with a distributed computing NIC 
card for improved performance in large packs. The PD-5 also comes standard with 
a biometric sharp grasping claws and a tail that adapts procedurally to maintain 
balance at high speeds as well as significantly more capacity for peripherals 
than its flying brethren. The grasping claws may make melee attacks with a Melee 
Miss Chance of 4 for 40 damage. PD-5 bots take a -2 Miss Chance for each other 
friendly PD-5 within 6m due to their distributed network architecture, but if 
one PD bot is pwned, all PD bots within that range are pwned as well. Disrupted 
PD-5 bots don't count for other's accuracy bonus.

    Standard PD bots make soft hydraulic sounds when moving, and so may not have 
stealth scores over 80. This limitation may be solved with clever RP, see your
GM with ideas.

    The reCON Direct Zero Robot is right where you need it to be. Or if not, 
It'll be there extremely soon. While it lacks a little in armor, it is the 
fastest drone available and carries a decent payload of peripherals. 
Unfortunately, its long range carrier wave makes it a little more prone to 
cyber attacks than its slower ilk. If the Con-D0R agile-wing drone has moved 
at least 10m in the last turn, enemies on the ground take a +2 to miss shooting
at it. If the Con-D0R has less than half of its ports occupied, enemies on the 
ground take an additional +1 when this effect is active.

    Cerberus attack drones are large, heavily armored and armed battlefield 
behemoths that move slowly but pack a nasty bite. Powered by an uberfuel that 
tends to explode in a 3m radius when destroyed. Any entity caught in the blast
takes 3 burn tokens and 50 Thermal Damage. They move slowly and have trouble 
with stairs, but their turret can quickly turn and fire. See the table below for 
stats on the armor of the drone when built by Engineers of different levels. 
One anti-vehicle hit will down them however. The Cerberus is large enough for a 
player to take partial cover behind. See the table below for stats on the main
turret.

90. When a character steps on a snare, their movement ends. They may not move 
until they pass a DC 60 Fortitude check. An additional fortitude check may be 
made at the cost of 1 action. If the engineer who made this is at least level 5 
and has an intelligence of at least 8, the DC to escape is 80. If Int 8 and 
level > 10, DC is 120. Snares burn if damaged with fire or plasma and break if 
slashed. Snares may be shot, but are considered 'hunkered behind cover' at all 
times. Snares cannot be detected with detect high tech. Snares will trap 
friendly characters.  

== ASPRO-S system   == 
Type:       Structure
Construction Cost:  30 Potential, 1 Munitions and 15 Material
Build Time:         4 Actions
Duration:           Permanent
Health:             50
Size:               1m x 1m x 3m

    You assemble an active countermeasure system that eliminates incoming 
explosive ordnance. When active, this system destroys any incoming grenades, 
missiles, rockets or thrown weapons that it has line of sight to from the top of 
its 3m mast within a 6m radius. Any incoming munitions are destroyed before they 
can detonate. Cannot stop incoming bullets, lasers, or plasma. Will stop some 
hostile Nanite attacks, see GM for specifics. 

    The sensors that detect incoming explosive ordnance are rather sensitive
and can easily be disrupted with a hacking DC check of 45 as long as the hacker
has an access point within 20m. If a hacker surpasses a DC of 120, the ASPRO-S
can be pwned and used to make a single ranged attack roll up to a range of 6m 
with a 4 chance to miss. If the attack hits, it deals 80 damage with an armor 
piercing level of 2. Firing the attack depletes the ASPRO-S, rendering it 
unable to stop further ordnance.

    You set up a machinegun turret that aims and fires on its own. The sentry is 
vulnerable to firmware security breach at DC 60. The turret can be affixed to 
any flat surface that is strong enough to support its weight.

        You gather materials from fallen foes or derelict equipment in 
the field to replenish your stock of components. You gain an amount of Material
depending on the condition, size, complexity and familiarity of what you are
scavenging. Your GM gets the final say on what your returns are, as a baseline,
an enemy Detachment Security Drone would be worth about 80 Material. You cannot
Scavenge active machinery. Some machinery may be too complex to scavenge or may
be incompatible with your microassembler.

    That's it. You've just had it with those ###holes behind cover over there 
taking potshots at you and your squad. This oughta teach 'em. You construct a 
mortar tube and shell printer. Deals 65 explosive damage in a 2m radius around a 
hit target with a chance to miss of 3. One shell "clip" takes 2 actions to 
reload. 130m range with a high arc. Ignores cover penalties if the shell comes 
straight down on top of the target. Successful hits have a 30% chance to daze 
the target. Every hit that an ally (not you) makes with a mortar that you placed 
gives you 40 Potential. Each emplacement comes with ten shells and may be refilled 
at a cost of 100 Potential.

== IED  == 
Type:               Trap
Construction Cost:  20 Potential, 15 Material and 1 Munition

Range:              5m radius

    May be set at the time of placement to be detonated by either proximity or 
remote. Remote detonation can be triggered in one Action by the engineer without
line of sight from a range of up to 120m. Remote detonation may be jammed by a 
hacker at a DC of 70. Proximity sensitivity can be determined at the time of 
placement to detonate on movement up to 4m away. A Stealth(DEX) check of DC 76
can prevent proximity detonation when moving through the watched zone. 

    Once placed, the IED can be defused with a Repair(INT) Check of DC 120. 
Failure to succeed on the check detonates the IED instantly. Taking more than 
10 fire or electric damage will detonate the IED as well. Don't forget to roll 
Stealth(CHA) to conceal it!

    Constructs an automated sentry turret armed with dual chainguns. The turret 
gets its own actions, and has the same initiative as the player who built it. 
Hacking DC of 40 to jam. Repair DC of 60 to fix a jam. Hacking DC of 90 to Pwn. 
Repair DC of 100 to purge a pwned sentry. Chain sentries come with 200 rounds. 
The stats above are for the combined chainguns. They may not be fired 
independently. Turns slowly; to change targets more than 90 degrees takes 2 
actions. Uses visible spectrum target identification.

    Even though Chain Sentries fire 8 bullets per action, only two bullets 
every burst proc any per-bullet effects.

    That's it. You've just had it with those ###holes behind cover over
there taking potshots at you and your squad. This oughta teach 'em. You 
construct a mortar tube and shell printer. Deals 80 explosive damage in a 3m 
radius around a hit target with a chance to miss of 3. Three shell "clip" with a 
2 action reload time. 300m range with a high arc. Ignores cover penalties if the 
shell comes straight down on top of the target. Successful hits have a 30%

    "um... sir, should you be... are you cleared to have that?" Won't detonate 
if shot. Even with plasma. And, boy does this sucker pack a punch. DC of 30 to 
hack it and set it off early. Setting one gives you a remote that can easily be 
held in an offhand, even if using a 2 handed weapon. If a teammate detonates 
the ANFO, the engineer that set it gains 10 Potential. Anyone within 9m radius of 
the blast gets an "ears are ringing" status effect which gives a -90% to 
perception checks based on sound for three Rounds. Remote ANFO comes in a sticky 
bundle and will cling to any shaped hard surface. It will even cling to the 
wings of dropships during reentry.

    You set up a local shield generator that creates a 4m radius dome
shield that nobody can shoot through, but anyone can walk through or melee
through. The shield will stop 120 damage per Round or one vehicle damage
before popping. Once a shield has popped, it will need to be repaired at a cost

        Perhaps one of your most useful talents is being able to 
quickly cobble together good cover from whatever is lying about and what
you brought in your pack. Sometimes this means ripping up the floor, digging
into the ground to make a simple pillbox, sometimes this means bolting some
ceramic plates onto that coffee table over there and setting it where you
need it to be. However you pull it off, you manage to create a 2m x 2m area
of good cover for 360 degrees.

Disrupt DC:     30
Pwn DC:         70

        You create a specialized drone that will only follow a Marksman
who is friendly. The spotter takes its turn with that marksman, and takes 
orders from that marksman. It comes equipped with night vision, thermal imaging,
advanced audio sensor arrays and EM spectrum sweepers. It gives audio and visual
cues to what it sees. Unless otherwise specified, it's voice is that of an 
English butler's. It may make up to 3 perception checks per turn using the 
Marksman's perception modifier (since they are working as a team) at a bonus of
20 points. It does not need to roll perception to detect cloaked characters 
within 20m, since they show up like lit Christmas trees on the EM sweepers. In 
an emergency, the spotter may move up to 12m and self-destruct on a close-range
target, dealing 30 explosive damage and emitting a flash similar to a flashbang. 
Spotters cannot leave their marksman, and do not occupy a control point. Unlike 
many similar models, the spotter drone is quite stealthy.

    You didn't exactly understand what your Hacker was saying about what was in 
this thing, but you could tell he was quite excited. Something about hexadecimal 
core processor, radio and wireless peripherals, embedded botnet, altera SHIELD 
encryption accelerator, digital signal processor, signal triangulator and all 
wrapped up with a web application firewall. Allows any Hacker within 8m of the 
station to make wireless hacking checks with a +20 to rolls. Gives friendly 
drones in range a +10 to resist being hacked. Also provides four friendly 
network nodes, all isolated by separate firewalls. The engineer who deployed 
this gets 10 Potential for each system disrupted and 20 Potential for each system 
pwned using this antenna.

    "I uh... haven't figured out how to fit the cartridge into a magazine 
without it ... you know... exploding. But what's in it should work just fine." 
You hand an allied gunslinger a little sidearm that has been your pet project 
for a while. Ignores shields. After every shot, the player who fired it rolls 
luck. If they roll over 80 (modified), all enemies who took damage have their 
shields wink out due to EMP. If they roll under 10, their shields and any nearby 
allies within 5m of them lose their shields due to EMP. Does not affect the 
function of drones or robots. Every enemy hit with the noisy cricket gives 30 
Potential to the engineer who built it.

    You create a small flying drone that follows one particular ally (not you). 
The drone carries an adaptive resonator and Nanite shield inductor that 
overcharges your teammate's shields to 40 points above their usual max. It also 
heals any damage to your teammate's shields by 20 points at the end of your 
teammate's turn every Round. It's not really quiet though, so the teammate that 
the drone is following cannot score stealth rolls above 70. For every 20 points 
(including the first 40 of over-heal) of shield strength that the drone heals, 
the engineer who built it gets 15 Potential in return.

    You construct a quadrupedal drone and upload the canine AI to it's 
processor. You imprint your team's hunter upon it. The pointer comes 
prefabricated with a head-mounted 12-gauge peripheral with 10 shots. It also has 
a "point" behavior which it uses to highlight targets for its master. The hunter 
who owns the pointer gets -2 to miss a highlighted target. A pointer cannot 
fire while pointing. Pointers are not quiet and cap stealth scores at 80.

    You set up and deploy a MD-413 surgical assistant hover drone. It follows 
one particular medic and speeds up all Hippocratic procedures to 1 action (no 
effect if an action would be just one action or faster anyway). It also adds a 
+15 to medical skill checks and adds a +15 to perception checks made by that 
medic. The medic drone does not cost any control points. The engineer who 
deployed the medic drone is able to reclaim 10 Potential every time the medic uses 
the drone to heal something. Medic drones are not quiet and limit a medic to a 
stealth score of 75 while active.

    You assemble a large antimatter slug impeller on the ground and instruct 
your weapons specialist to pick it up and use it until the canister runs out. 
You explain that he shouldn't drop it, but don't break his brain with the

Disrupt DC:         60
Pwn DC:             90

    You set up and deploy a quad rotor flying combat assist drone and task it to 
follow the direction of one of your allies (not you). While unladen, its rotors 
run slightly quieter than most; as long as it isn't carrying anything and its 
ports are unused, it has a maximum stealth check of 90. It runs on a Li+ battery 
and almost never explodes when destroyed. When a drone is reclaimed, it does not 
reimburse its controller's construction materials that were used to assemble it.
