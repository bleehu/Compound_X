Repair Processes 
==============================

===== Cyberphysical =====

== Reboot   == 
Potential Gain:65
Action:     2 Actions
Duration:   N/A
Range:      Touch

    Only usable on cybernetic allies that are "bleeding" out. That ally
is now stable and has 30 hp, rather than having to stabilize the target and 
then heal them. Not a quiet procedure; detectable within 40m by a perception 
check of 30.

== Data Scrub   == 
Potential Gain: 35
Action:      1 Action
Duration:    N/A
Range:       Touch

    Only usable on cybernetic allies who have been hacked or dominated.
The engineer makes a repair check opposed by half of the hacker's hack check or
dominator's domination check. If the engineer wins, the ally or system is 
scrubbed and the system control returns to normal. The engineer only receives 
Potential for successful scrubs. Be aware that engineers are the only class with 
this Process, but not the only class that can scrub a hacked target.

== Restore Armor    == 
Potential Gain:   50
Action:        2 Actions
Duration:      Almost Instant
Range:         Touch

    You tinker with your ally's armor and mend it. Undo any debuffs on
your ally's armor such as sundering, battle damage, etc. 

== Percussive Maintenance   == 
Potential Gain:  30
Action:       1 Action
Duration:     Almost Instant
Range:        Touch

    This stupid thing is broken again! You hit it with your wrench and
deal 10 blunt melee damage to it. Roll luck modifier, with a DC of 1.5 x 
target's total damage after wrench hit. Add to that DC 10 for each minor status 
effect and 15 for each major status effect, at the GM's discretion. If The DC is 
passed, pick an option from the list below. This process may only be performed 
on cybernetic allies, turrets, vehicles or as an RP event. Not to be confused 
with the Concussive Maintenance Feat.

*  Heal all minor conditions
*  Heal one major condition
*  Heal 25 + 5d10 health

== Defrag   == 
Potential Gain:15
Action:     1 Action
Duration:   Until First Use
Range:      Touch

    You auto-balance your cybernetic ally's priority queues, defrag
their memory and basically perform typical maintenance. Feeling refreshed,
your ally continues on their way. Your ally gets a +5% bonus to their next
RP roll.

== Actuator Overdrive   == 
Potential Gain:20
Action:     1 Action
Duration:   engagement
Range:      Touch

    For the duration of an engagement, an ally moves 3m per action more. Ally 
movement has an absolute cap of 14m per action, even if some other effect
would make it higher. A player may not be overdriven/overclocked more than 
once per engagement. Only works on cybernetic allies.


== Discrete Overclock   == 
Potential Gain:20
Action:     1 Action
Duration:   Engagement
Range:      Touch

    A cybernetic ally gets a -1 to miss for the duration of the engagement. They 
also get a +15 to reloading weapons quickly and a +10 to perception checks. 
Cannot Overclock an Ally more than once per engagement.

== Network Targeting    == 
Potential Gain:20
Action:     1 Action
Duration:   Until First Use
Range:      Touch

    You interface a visual triangulation unit with your cybernetic 
ally's visual sensors. It cross-references targets with other friendly 
machine's sensors to deliver a more complete image of the target. Your
cybernetic ally gets a -1 to miss their next target for each friendly
drone, robot and turret that is also looking at that target. This effect
may be blocked with a hacking attack at DC 20. 

== System Overclock == 
Potential Gain:35
Action:     1 Action
Duration:   Engagement
Range:      Touch

    A cybernetic ally gets a -2 to miss for the duration of the engagement.
They also get a +35 to reloading weapons quickly and a +10 to perception checks, 
but take 20 Internal Damage from system overheat.

== Colocation Processing    == 
Potential Gain:20
Action:     1 Action
Duration:   Until First Use
Range:      6m

    You use your onboard manufacturing system processor as a dedicated
server to help process your cybernetic ally's analytic data. The next time that
ally makes a lockpick, hacking, explosives, repair, heal, or tracking check, 
they get a +15 to it. 

== Regression Override  == 
Potential Gain:60
Action:     1 Action
Duration:   8 Rounds
Range:      Touch

    You temporarily disable your cybernetic ally's regression process,
the part of their personality program that slows down to triple check the 
results of their actions. This sends them into a rage mode. They still know
friend from foe, and they still have a janky understanding of their higher-
order skills like lockpicking, hacking, or social finesse, but they have no
fear, no pain, no remorse and no hesitation for about half of a minute. Your
ally Cannot feel shock during this duration, and cannot be repaired (they
won't stand still). 

    Your Cybernetic Ally gets a bonus +3 to accuracy nearer than 41m. They also 
deal an extra 20 damage with melee hits and may aim as a free action with a 
ranged weapon as long as they pass a REF check of DC 60. They take a penalty of 
-25% to skill checks, including acrobat or athletics checks (these take 
regression to calculate). An ally affected by Regression Override may use a 
Strength +2 bonus at any time, but each time they do, they take 20 Internal 
Damage of wear and tear. An Engineer can only perform a Regression Override 
once per Encounter. Regression Overrides do not stack.

== System Restore   == 
Potential Gain:35
Action:     2 Actions
Duration:   Permanent
Range:      Touch

    Can only be used on a cybernetic subject whose primary data center is still 
intact that has "bled out" less than 8 Rounds ago. The Engineer makes a DC 60 
Repair check. If successful, the subject is now "bleeding out". If the subject 
is saved, they get the feat "Refurbished". Characters with the "Refurbished" 
feat have a permanent -1 to Intelligence and can never again be revived with 
System Restore.

===== Material/Mechanic =====

== Duct Tape    == 
Potential Gain:40
Action:     2 Actions
Duration:   N/A
Range:      Touch

    You must have your Extruder drawn in order to use this ability. This process
only works on a cybernetic patient. Your patient heals an ammount of health 
listed on the table below. As your character learns more repair skill, the 
better they heal. Unless otherwise stated, this ability cannot heal a patient 
above half health.

+-----------------+--------------+--------+
|  Repair Skill   | Base Healing |  Dice  |
+-----------------+--------------+--------+
|       10        |     20       | + 2d10 |
+-----------------+--------------+--------+
|       20        |     30       | + 3d10 |
+-----------------+--------------+--------+
|       30        |     35       | + 4d10 |
+-----------------+--------------+--------+
|       40        |     40       | + 5d10 |
+-----------------+--------------+--------+
|       50        |     50       | + 6d10 |
+-----------------+--------------+--------+

== Weapon Tuning    == 
Potential Gain:20
Action:     1 Action
Duration:   engagement
Range:      Touch

    You fiddle with your ally's gun quickly. You tune the whosits, and
dial the whatsits. It now has a -1 to its Miss Chances in all range brackets and 
has half the chance of jamming, rounded down. Normal use and wear on the gun will 
almost definitely unalign what you've done by the end of the engagement, but 
hopefully your efforts will help keep your ally alive until then.

== Vehicle Repair   == 
Potential Gain:40
Action:     4 Actions
Duration:   almost instant
Range:      Touch

    You pull out your tools and quickly repair the damage to a friendly
vehicle. It gains 1 vehicle health. While this power is not required to repair
vehicles, it does add a Potential reward for doing so. It also increases the 
effect and may reduce the time taken to repair. 


== Fortify  == 
Potential Gain: 30
Action:     2 Actions
Duration:   N/A
Range:      Touch

    You set your extruder to emit a light, ballistic-absorbing crystalizing gel.
It doesn't last very long in the elements and slowly turns to dust as the patient
moves, but it reduces incoming kinetic and thermal engery wonderfully. It has
carcenogenic proporties when used on organic matter.

    You must have your extruder drawn in order to use this process. This process
only works on cybernetic patients. The patient gets temporary health equal to
4 d10. Temporary health goes to zero at the end of the encounter.

== Micro Assembler  == 
Potential Gain:50
Action:     1 Action
Duration:   8 Rounds
Range:      Touch

    You release a spider-like micro repair bot that repairs a cybernetic
ally for 8 Rounds before running out of power. The microbot is able to heal
15 health per turn. Once spent, the microbot burns itself up. A Microassembler 
uses wireless cloud calculation to stay small, but on-blueprint. As such, it is 
vulnerable to hack checks at a DC of 50. A hacked micro assembler reveals its 
location and may deal 5 Internal Damage per Round at the end of the hacker's 
turn.

== Engine Tuning    == 
Potential Gain:50
Action:     6 Actions
Duration:   Almost Instant
Range:      Touch

    You crack open the hood of whatever vehicle is around and begin to
clean the spark plug, dial in the cylinder timing and add your own special
sauce to the engine's fuel injector. It will now run at 125% power, and it has
full health. Effect may vary by RP. See GM for details. While this power is not
required to boost the effect of a vehicle, it now rewards you in Potential for
doing so and increases your effectiveness at doing so.

== Boilerplate Handiwork    == 
Potential Gain:   20 Potential
Material Cost: 20 Material
Action:        1 Action
Duration:      Permanent
Range:         Touch

    Just slam some more metal on there! You add a protective layer to
one of your cybernetic allies. This adds 40 to their health, but slows them
down by 1m per action. This effect lasts until that 40 health has been 
destroyed, or until the engineer takes it off and discards it.

== Zero Friction Covalent   == 
Potential Gain:20
Action:     1 Action
Duration:   Until next melee hit
Range:      Touch

    You coat your ally's weapon with a friction-negating substance that
binds with the blade on the molecular level, which makes it easier to slice 
through targets. Add one to the weapon's damage multiplier. The substance isn't
very durable and is difficult to handle, so an engineer can't use it on their
own weapon and the effect only lasts until the next hit. Cannot be used on a 
weapon more than once at a time.

== Sup it Up    == 
Potential Gain:80
Action:     12 Actions
Duration:   Permanent
Range:      Touch

    Target friendly vehicle has full health, and its engine runs at
maximum efficiency. Full effect is up to Role Playing and GM. Additions
include but are not limited to:

*  adding a NOS tank
*  adding a 1-vehicle damage shield
*  adding stabilized chassis for improved accuracy when fired from 

== Ceramic Catalyst == 
Potential Gain: 15 Potential
Action:         2 Actions
Duration:       10 Rounds or 2 hits
Range:          Touch

    An adhesive mist of kinetic-reactive ions that cause ceramic armor plates to 
absorb hits more efficiently by powdering instead of cracking. Toxic, but 
slow-acting to most biologic life forms. Can only be used on cybernetic allies 
with light, medium, heavy or full armor. Reduces the next bullet hit by 50 
points of damage. Looks kinda like yellow ooze. Gives an ally affected by 
Ceramic Catalyst a -20 penalty to visual stealth rolls. An engineer cannot use 
ceramic catalyst on themselves. Ceramic Catalyst decays after exposure to 
elements for ten Rounds or three hits, whichever happens first. 

== Microbot Swarm   == 
Potential Gain:40 * n
Action:     1 Action
Duration:   8 Rounds
Range:      4m radius

    You release a swarm of spider-like micro repair bots that repair 
cybernetic allies for 8 Rounds before running out of power. The microbots are 
able to heal 15 health per Round at the end of the ally's Turn. The microbots 
burn up if one of their subjects is affected by plasma burn. For this, the 
Engineer gains 40 * n Potential, where n is the number of allies affected. The 
Engineer can only perform this once per engagement. A Microassembler uses 
wireless cloud calculation to stay small, but on-blueprint. As such, it is 
vulnerable to hack checks at a DC of 50. A hacked micro assembler reveals its 
location and may deal 5 Internal Damage per Round at the end of the hacker's 
turn. The microbot swarm director automatically detects disobedient microbots 
and notifies the Engineer, but cannot stop the damage from happening. 

===== Optronic/Cycotonic =====

== Repulsor Recharge    == 
Potential Gain: 20 Potential
Action:         1 Action
Duration:       Immediate
Range:          Touch

        Recharges an ally's shield by 60 points. Cannot be used to
charge an ally's shields over their max value. An Engineer cannot recharge
their own shields.

== Sensory Fuse == 
Potential Gain: 10 Potential
Action:         1 Action
Duration:       Until fuse pops
Range:          Touch

        You install an auto-ejecting Sensory Overload Fuse in your
cybernetic ally's audio and visual signal processors. The fuse pops and 
negates the effect of a flashbang or other such device. Fuses take a steady
hand to install, so an engineer cannot install one in themselves.


== B-Filter Buffer  == 
Potential Gain: 15 Potential
Action:         1 Action
Duration:       For one visual perception check
Range:          Touch

    Adds a hyper-fast self-consuming buffer between a cybernetic ally's 
optics and their processor. This filter interfaces with the Bayer Filter to 
remove false artifacts and perform several Just-In-Time post processing. Uses 
a disposable one-time use paracrystal network that degrades after a time for 
optimal efficiency. Increases ally's visual perception by 10%.

== Repulsor Overcharge  == 
Potential Gain: 25 Potential
Action:         1 Action
Duration:       Immediate
Range:          Touch

        Recharges an ally's shield by 60 points. May be used to charge
an ally's shields to up to 30 points above their maximum. Shields will 
normalize down to their maximum after ten Rounds. 

== Refractory Spray == 
Potential Gain: 15 Potential
Material Cost:  15 Material
Action:         2 Actions
Duration:       Immediate
Range:          Touch

    An adhesive mist of refractive particles that absorb laser and plasma fire 
quite well. Reduces either the next plasma/VAE hit by 65 points of damage or 
laser hit by 45 damage. It also prevents the first damage-over-time effect from 
that hit (such as plasma burn), if it has one. Looks kinda like sticky glitter. 
Gives an ally affected by Refractory spray a -20 penalty to visual stealth 
rolls. Refractory Spray can be detected by metal detectors. Refractory Spray 
loses cohesion after ten Rounds or burns up if hit by a plasma or laser attack.

    At level 10, you learn how to apply the spray more evenly and to apply it
more liberally to areas that you have seen get hit more often. As such, you are
able to stop 80 points of VAE or plasma damage or 60 points of laser damage.

== Tune Laser   == 
Potential Gain: 30 Potential
Action:         2 Actions
Duration:       5 Rounds
Range:          Touch

    You dial in the potentiometers and realign the focusing crystals. Your 
ally's laser weapon deals an extra 20 points of damage per hit and has a -1 to 
miss (To a minimum to-miss of -0 when target is in light cover). These 
adjustments will likely lose precision after 5 Rounds of combat, and the weapon
will return to the state it was in before tuning.

== MoCap Augmentation   == 
Potential Gain: 20 Potential
Action:         2 Actions
Duration:       Immediate
Range:          Touch

    By temporarily reducing the resolution of your cybernetic ally's visual 
sensors you radically reduce the processing power it takes to capture motion, 
letting them process more frames per microsecond. This gives them slightly 
faster reaction times, resulting in a -1 chance to miss when attacking, but 
makes it much harder to see long distances. Allies with MoCap Augmentation 
active take a -40 to perception checks at ranges beyond 50m. Since this is less 
than ideal in non-combat scenarios, you've set it to wear off after ten Rounds.

== Repulsor Projection  == 
Potential Gain: 10 Potential
Action:         1 Action
Duration:       Immediate
Range:          10m

    Recharges an ally's shield by 40 points. May not be used to charge a shield 
above its maximum capacity. An engineer may not charge their own shields. 

== Repulsor Hypercharge == 
Potential Gain: 40 Potential
Action:         2 Actions
Duration:       Immediate
Range:          Touch

    Recharges an ally's shield by 85 points. May be used to charge an ally's 
shields up to 60 points above their maximum. Shields will normalize down to 
their maximum by 5 points per Round at the beginning of that player's turn. 
Hypercharged shields make a distinctive crackling noise; players whose shields 
are Hypercharged take a -20 to stealth rolls. An Engineer cannot Hypercharge 
their own shields.

== Broadcast Repulsion  == 
Potential Gain: 15 * n Potential, where n is the number of shields affected
Action:         2 Actions
Duration:       Immediate
Range:          8m radius centered on engineer

    All allies with shields in the area of effect have their shields recharged 
by 40 points. This may not charge them over their maximum. If more than two 
shields were affected and more than 60 points restored total, the feedback wave 
sets a 10 blunt force damage per Round for 4 turns to any enemies in the area of 
effect as well. A feedback wave ends the Engineer's turn immediately.

== Plasma Lacer == 
Potential Gain: 20 Potential and 1 Munitions
Action:         2 Actions
Duration:       10 Shots
Range:          Touch

    You must pass a DC 40 skill check on your ally's weapon to replace their 
muzzle mod with a Plasma-Lacing capacitor. Their next ten shots set a 2 tokens 
of Plasma Burn. After that ten shots, the Lacer's capacitor will have grounded 
and subsequent shots will jam the gun. Your ally will have to make a skill check 
to swap back their muzzle attachment.
