These add-ons are stat affected items or items that will add functionality to a 
weapon. Most Attachments can be affixed to any weapon unless otherwise 
noted. Ask a GM if you are not sure.

Please note that unless otherwise specified, only one attachment of a given type may
be used. For instance, one cannot use two red lasers to get a -30% to miss chance, nor 
can you use both a reflex sight and a 3.2x scope.
