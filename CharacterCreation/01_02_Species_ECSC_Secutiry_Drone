ECSC Class-A Security Drone
==============================

  Security Drones are specialized drones that have been granted a greater AI 
capacity to learn and think independently. They are native to ECSC Compound X 
experimentation laboratory.

===== Appearance/Anatomy ===== 

  Built specifically for security and military counterparts, as their name suggests,
Class-A Security Drones have a steel reinforced frame, with a built-in modular 
armor rig. The coloration of plating can range anywhere in the natural colors and 
camouflages, to the standard ECSC Matte Grey. 

  They are considered a Large species, as the standard models are over 6’ tall and
weight between 400 and 700 lbs. 

  When fully-armored, these drones are very difficult to gain physical access to. 
Negating or destroying armor plates only makes the interior workings easier to 
get to. Underneath their armor, drones have another weak carapace that is 
defensively analogous to human skin. There are two main panels/access points 
on these drones. The first is the on the head, containing {Insert Techteam 
Technobabble}. The second, on the chest, containing {Insert more Techteam Technobabble}

===== Society =====

  Built by the ECSC Compound X experimentation laboratory, Detachment A Security 
Drones have an AI greater than their B and C counterparts. Their programming has 
enough flaws to be susceptible to hacking, but is advanced enough to spark debate 
bout sentience and rights.


Types: 
*Mechanical
*Independant AI
*Nuclear Fission Core
*Magnetic Induction

===== Language: Various =====  
  As Natives to the ECSC, Security Drones speak Terran Common by default. Drones 
specifically manufactured to work with certain people groups will also speak the 
regional language. For instance, a Drone to be sent to Hera, where the primary spoken
language is Mandar, would therefore be outfitted with a Mandar language database.

Immune to Poison.
Immune to Intoxication.

Weakness to Electrical: Electrical damage deals an additional 50% damage.

===== Traits ===== 

Built-in armor:
  As an ECSC-manufactured drone, you have the ability to use the ECSC speciality 
drone armor sets.[Access to ECSC Special Drone Armor]

Inhuman Strength:
  Built specifically for lifting and holing great weights, you are far stronger 
than you biological counterparts. [+ Some Max Carry weight]
