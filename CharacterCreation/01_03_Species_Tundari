Tundari
==============================

===== Society =====

	The Tundari are a species of obligate carnivores from the planet Tundaar. Physically, 
they span a wide size range, from the Chi’mau, who can range from 3’6” to 5’ and 
85-130 lbs to the Sang’mau, at 6’ to 7’ and up to 400 lbs, and every size in-between. 
Like humans, body types persist in many forms.

	A sleek coat of fur covers these people, ranging widely in color and pattern. It 
tends to grow short and fine over the majority of the body, however, the face, head, 
neck, and joints have been known to grow hair that is longer and coarser, having a 
mane or scruff-like quality about it. 

	As many cultures mark themselves with tattoos, the Tundari also have their own method
of skin-marking. Some outliers will dye their fur, but that is generally frowned upon 
by much of Tundari society. The traditional method of marking is called Aranga, 
though many ranchers will would recognize the method as very similar to the freeze-
branding they mark livestock with. Aranga, however, is far more intricate that simple 
freeze-branding.

	As a carnivorous species, they have large, forward, wide-set eyes, clawed limbs and 
large, sharp teeth. Their ears sprout from closer to the top of their heads than the 
sides, and can be triangular or round. 
They are considered a hardy species, but have not adapted well to fight off poisons 
or foreign contaminants. They are diurnal, and have low-light eyesight, but can 
also see well in daylight. 

	Culturally and economically, the clans on the Tunadri homeworld have an instated 
breeding season once every four years. Cubs born outside of this season are not 
harmed, but their parents are firmly reprimanded for the first, and drastic measures 
may be taken if a single family has multiple children outside of the typical breeding 
times. Rather than the byproduct of a controlling government, these mandates came 
into effect nearly four-hundred years prior. As infant mortality rates decreased, the
population increased far more rapidly than their ecosystem could handle. They have 
kept their population stable for the last three centuries, and no one seems inclined 
to change their ways. Space exploration and colonization have begun to change that, 
but many colonists still ascribe to the old mandates.

Types:
* Biological
* Mammalian
* Warm-blooded 
* Carnivorous 

Weakness to Poisons/Contagions:
	Your saves to avoid being infected by a poison or afflicted by a contagion are 
rolled with Disadvantage. This applies only to initial rolls for a particular toxin, not 
subsequent rolls regarding complications or recovery.


===== Language: Tuunra ===== 

	While different clans have their own unique dialects, they are similar enough that 
they can be understood well by all. Tuunra features drawn-out vowels, soft consonants,
and sounds such as clicks, chirps, trills, and a low rumbling that is nearly inaudible 
to humans. There is another integral part of Tuunra that many species do not pick up
on, and that is an intricate system of body language that involves both tail and ears.
A Tundari that has lost their tail may have great difficulty getting their point across
to others of their species.

	Tundari can communicate basic ideas and general instructions noiselessly. 

===== Names ===== 

	First names range very much as humans, as far as origin. Often having some significance 
with the family, first names are fairly arbitrary in much of Tundari society. Tribe and 
clan names are held the most important, and as such, are always listed first.
Some Tundari have been exiled, lost their clan names, or adopted their own. Others have 
adopted names from the other cultures they now live in.

==============================
Tundari Clans
==============================

===== Rra’mau =====

Size: Medium/Large
Favored Terrain: Plains

Appearance: 
	These clans tend to have coats that range from tawny to sorrel. They are 
leaner than the Sang’mau, as a whole.

Tribe: 
	The most social of all the clans, Rra’mau is the face for intergalactic trade,
policies, and general hospitality to outsiders. While the clans all meet together to 
decide these policies beforehand, (usually) for the betterment of the species, Rra’mau
merely figure-head the process to outsiders.

== Available Traits ==

Hind-Claws:
	Digging into the ground with the large claws present on your hind-limbs spurs your 
ability to run much faster than your peers. [Round movement speed calculations up]


Wide-faced:
	Many species seem to be drawn to your large eyes. You aren’t certain why, but it gives 
you an advantage when attempting to persuade or charm members of other biological species. 
[Persuade at Advantage once per individual]



===== Sang’mau =====

Size: Large
Favored Terrain: Forest/Jungle

Appearance: 
	Coat range from black to tawny to brighter colors such as orange and red. 
These tundari are larger, more powerful hunters than their cousins, relying more on brute 
strength and ambushing than on speed. While the trees on Tundaar well supported the weight 
of these people, it is hard to find natural equivalents on other planets.

Tribe: 
	Another very social clan, the Sang’mau were deemed too frightening to be the best 
negotiators after first contact with the Terrans, when the visiting diplomat fainted at 
the mere sight. More commonplace now, this clan tends to stay out of the direct Terran-
Tundari diplomacy. 

== Available Traits ==

Climbing: 
	A long tail and a lack of fear for heights allows climbing to come very naturally to you. 
[Gain Advantage on STR-Athletics Checks when Climbing]

Powerful: 
	Large, developed muscles allow you to carry more and hit harder. 
[Active Carry Penalties reduced. More Damage for Hand-to-Hand]



===== Chi’mau =====

Size: Small
Favored Terrain: Urban/Rocky

Appearance: 
	Coats range from a red-tawny to grey and black. These Tundari are the smallest 
in both size and number of the large clans. They are more solitary than either of the larger
clans. 

Swimmer: 
	You are an expert at swimming. A thick coat of fur protects you from the chill of 
the water, and you can hold your breath for quite some time.

[Gain Proficiency in Jury-Rigging]
