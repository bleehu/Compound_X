==============================
Step 0: Ask for Advice
==============================

	No really, if you get stuck at any point or just want a second opinion, 
other players can be tremendously helpful and are usually more than happy to 
assist new players getting their feet wet.

==============================
Step 1: Race
==============================

==============================
Step 2: Class
==============================

	Your character's class represents his or her core training and 
competencies. It determines your options for how the character fights, 
influences skills, and generally tells a fair bit about who the character is 
and what he or she has done.

	The various classes in Compound X are roughly equal in power, but not 
in complexity. On the simpler side are the Soldier, Specialist, Gunslinger, 
and Pilot. We recommend players newer to Compound X or roleplaying games in 
general try one of these first.

	The Soldier is the archetypal ... soldier. Trained and equipped for 
cover-based gunfighting, the Soldier has unique access to Battle Rifles, the 
most powerful class of assault rifles. It is a flexible class that can be 
taken in many directions with different ability and skill distributions.

	Specialists trade in much of the Soldier's flexibility for access to 
Heavy Armoring, Machine Guns, and Heavy Weapons, which includes such 
offerings as flamethrowers, miniguns, and rocket launchers. The Specialist 
tends toward brute force solutions, highly capable of blasting through 
obstacles, but suffers by comparison in the realms of squad utility, stealth 
or social scenarios, and close-quarters combat.

	The Gunslinger is a close-quarters gunfighting ... specialist. Though 
lacking the use of weapons heavier than pistols, the class receives unique 
bonuses to their use and is naturally hard to hit, making it terrifying in 
enclosed spaces. Naturally, their capabilities on large, open battlegrounds 
are somewhat diminished.

	The Pilot trades in much of the Soldier's combat capabilities for 
unique bonuses to activities involving the Vehicle skill family. Generally 
restricted to short-ranged gunplay, Pilots are notorious for finding 
creative, vehicular solutions to the tactical puzzle.

	If you aren't sure what class to pick, we recommend playing a 
Soldier. Its versatility and ability to specialize in almost any area 
offer the most opportunity for growing a character as you play.

==============================
Step 3: Background and Skills
==============================

==============================
Step 4: Attribute Point Allocation
==============================

	Now that you know your character's primary (from your class) and 
secondary (from your skills) capabilities, you have all the information you need 
to decide your character's attributes. You have a total number of attribute 
points to allocate based on your choice of race, and 7 attributes to which to 
allocate them. Basic Rules.txt describes what each attribute does in a vacuum if
you need a refresher. Here are a few pointers:

	1) Unless you know what you are doing, avoid giving your character less 
than 6 FORT. FORT directly determines your health points, and having enough of
them contributes positively to survival.
	
	2) Have at least 6 in either STR or DEX, and if possible up to 8. One of 
these stats will determine your movement speed, which is of high value.

	3) Have at least 4 Luck. Luck is a unique attribute and its value can be 
hard to gauge without experiencing its effects firsthand.

	4) Avoid the 6-6-6-6-6-6-6 even attribute spread. While you won't be bad 
at anything, you also won't be particularly good at anything. As in real life, 
it will be more fun for the group if characters are good at some things and not 
so good at others, so that players can take turns in the spotlight.

	One way to go about this process is to decide on 2-3 things you want your 
character to be especially good at, based both on what the attributes themselves 
do and the dependencies of the skills you selected, and giving those stats a 
number between 7-9 each. Then give a 3-5 to one or two things your character won't 
be as good at, and finally adjust your numbers as necessary to give medium scores 
to the remaining attributes.

==============================
Step 5: Feats
==============================

	If you are making a level 1 character, you do not need to worry about 
feats. If your GM wants you to begin at a higher level, you may wish to ask 
them for advice on which feats to take.

==============================
Step 6: Weapons, Attachments, and Armor
==============================

	Weapon and Armor proficiencies are determined by your class, as is your 
financial reach. Usually, though not always, youwill want to acquire the heaviest 
type of armor your class has access to. Weapons are trickier, as each type of 
weapon is the best class of weapon for a particular task. As a Soldier, you 
probably want a carbine or assault rifle so that youcan engage in any mid-range 
combat. If money permits you may also want a sidearm and/or melee weapon to 
shore up close-quarters fighting.

==============================
Step 7: Equipment
==============================

	Any remaining credits you have can be spent on miscellaneous equipment 
from the 
[Items](https://github.com/bleehu/Compound_X/blob/play/CharacterCreation/07_Items.txt) 
document. Take whatever items youfind that fit your character's aesthetic. We 
recommend on gneral principles always having a communicator of some type and if 
money permits a medkit/repair kit or two, depending on whether your race is 
organic or robotic.
