## Step 0: Ask for Advice
No really, if you get stuck at any point or just want a second opinion, other players can be tremendously helpful and
are usually more than happy to assist new players getting their feet wet.

## Step 1: Race


## Step 2: Class


## Step 3: Background and Skills


## Step 4: Attribute Point Allocation
Now that you know your character's primary (from your class) and secondary (from your skills) capabilities, you have all 
the information you need to decide your character's attributes. You have a total number of attribute points to allocate 
based on your choice of race, and 7 attributes to which to allocate them. Basic Rules.txt describes what each attribute 
does in a vacuum if you need a refresher. Here are a few pointers:
1. Unless you know what you are doing, do not give your character less than 6 FORT. FORT directly determines your health
points, and having enough of them contributes to not dying.
2. Have at least 6 in either STR or DEX, and if possible up to 8. One of these stats will determine your movement speed,
which is of high value.
3. Have at least 4 Luck. Luck is a unique attribute and its value can be hard to gauge without experiencing its effects 
firsthand.
4. Avoid the 6-6-6-6-6-6-6 even attribute spread. While you won't be bad at anything, you also won't be particularly good 
at anything. It will be more fun for the whole group if characters are good at some things and not so good at others, as
in real life.
One way to go about this process is to decide on 2-3 things you want your character to be especially good at, based both 
on what the attributes themselves do and the dependencies of the skills you selected, and giving those stats a number 
between 7-9 each. Then give a 3-5 to one or two things your character won't be as good at, and finally adjust your numbers 
as necessary to give medium scores to the remaining attributes.

## Step 5: Feats
If you are making a level 1 character, you do not need to worry about feats. If your GM wants you to begin at a higher 
level, you may wish to ask them for advice on which feats to take.

## Step 6: Weapons, Attachments, and Armor
Weapon and Armor proficiencies are determined by your class, as is your financial reach. Usually, though not always, you
will want to acquire the heaviest type of armor your class has access to. Weapons are trickier, as each type of weapon
is the best class of weapon for a particular task. As a Soldier, you probably want a carbine or assault rifle so that you
can engage in any mid-range combat. If money permits you may also want a sidearm and/or melee weapon to shore up close-
quarters fighting.

## Step 7: Equipment
Any remaining moneys you have can be spent on miscellaneous equipment from the [Items](https://github.com/bleehu/Compound_X/blob/play/CharacterCreation/07_Items.txt) document. Take whatever items you
find that fit your character's aesthetic. We recommend on gneral principles always having a communicator of some type 
and if money permits a medkit/repair kit or two, depending on whether your race is organic or robotic.
