==============================
Core Classes
==============================

	Your character starts at level 0. At level 0 you have skills, but no class, 
class feats or regular feats. At level 1 you get to select a class, and receive 
the class passives. However, you do not select a class feat until level 5. Then, 
at levels 10, 15, and 20 you can gain another class feat.

	For any listed class, if it says "Gain X Skill at 10" that means you get to 
add the X skill to your skill list. For more on Skills, see "RP / Using Skills" 
Section of Basic Rules.txt.

darkness or darker, the Detect and Moving Detect DC increases by 10. In the darkness,
a skilled assassin won't be seen, even when being looked at. However, in daylight,
even the most skilled assassin can be seen if their silhouette is carelessly shown.

invisible as a more powerful cloaking device, but it does allow you to hide in 
plain sight. There is no Nanite Activation Cost, Nanite upkeep, or Cloak Turns 
as the Shadow Cloak is special item. 
**Except when attacking: you must wait until the start of the following turn 
before the cloak resumes.

=====   MONK   =====
	Head to any secluded Temple and you'll find many Monks studying the ancient 
texts and learning about sacred objects. Of these holy disciples, a few are 
trained to defend the Temple in case of attack. All Monks take an Oath to not 
utilize "lesser" technologies [guns, armor, and even Nanite packs.], for only 
through embracing the Higher Technologies can one Advance oneself to the planes 
of the Great Ones.

	Roll a Knowledge[Nanites] check, DC 50. You may teleport up to Result-50/10

	skill check. Monks still receive a penalty attack for performing a skill check 
	in melee combat.
