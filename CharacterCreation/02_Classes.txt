==============================
Core Classes
==============================

	Your character starts at level 0. At level 0 you have skills, but no class, 
class feats or regular feats. At level 1 you get to select a class, and receive 
the class passives. However, you do not select a class feat until level 5. Then, 
at levels 10, 15, and 20 you can gain another class feat.

	For any listed class, if it says "Gain X Skill at 10" that means you get to 
add the X skill to your skill list. For more on Skills, see "RP / Using Skills" 
Section of Basic Rules.txt.

== Class Feats ==

Battle Hardened:

    Your body and mind are used to the constant strain of combat. You no longer
recoil quite so much from the horrors of war like a greenhorn and it takes more
to shock you. Your pain tolerance has grown and you are more conscious of your
surroundings. You gain the following:

* + 8 to your Will Save
* + 8 to your Shock Save
* + 8 to your Reflex Save
* + 8 to your Awareness Save
* + 30 to your maximum health

Grizzled Veteran:

    You thrive on gunfighting. You love the smell of napalm in the morning. 
You've had so much shrappnel in your body that it's gotten homeostatically used
to it. This Feat cannot be taken unless you have "Battle Hardened" and are level 
10. You gain the following:

* An additional +20 to your maximum health
* If you would fail a reload roll, you succeed instead as long as you didn't critically fail    

Raise Morale:

	You roar to incite courage in your allies. The roar takes 1 Action to 
complete and requires you to pass a DC 50 Charisma check. If you succeed, you 
give allied Characters a +20 on their next skill roll or +2 on their next
attack roll. This includes your next roll. Allies must be able to hear and 
understand you to get the bonus. Max 1 successful use per encounter.

Battle Cry:

	You give a violent yell that spurs you and your teammates on, giving them
the sense that victory is possible. In order for your cry to work, you must pass
a DC 25 Charisma check. If successful, your Battle Cry gives you and your 
teammates a +30 on their next skill roll or +3 added to their next attack roll. A 
Character must be level 10 and have the "Raise Morale" Class Feat in order to 
take this feat. This ability takes 1 Action and can only be used once per 
encounter. This ability replaces Raise Morale.

Fight Fiercely First:

	You gain an additional +10 to initiative rolls. In addition, you get a +3 to
accuracy against enemies who have not taken a turn yet in combat or whom you
have beaten in the reflex roll when room clearing until that character takes a 
turn.

Surpise and Violence of Action:

	The soldier's accuracy bonus effect works on any enemy with a lower 
initiative until that enemy has finished their 3rd turn. A Character cannot take
this Class Feat unless they are level 10 and have the "Fight Fiercely First"
Class Feat as well.


=====   SPECIALIST   =====
	There is always a need for the type of person willing and able to bring the 
heaviest of fire down upon their enemies. The Specialist will be there when the 
odds are stacked highest against the forces for good, and he'll be prepared to 
use heavy force to even those odds.

=====   HUNTER   =====

	Unlike many of your compatriots who prefer the cold comforts of technology,
you have an affinity for the frontier. The great outdoors. Be they the 
wind-swept plains of frontier farms, the thick jungles of Tundaar or the swamps
of Trioch, you love it all. You are much more likely to know which plants won't 
kill you to eat if you get hungry, and you can make a fire by breaking the flint
rocks of Kalimba against each other. You may not be much for book learnin', but
you know that a keen eye and a choice blast from your shotgun wins the kind of
arguments you're most like to have out on the rim.

== Hunter's Dog ==

    When your character ascends to level 3, you receive an attack dog. Maybe 
you found the dog along your last mission, or maybe a dog was issued to you when
you returned to home base (at the GM's choice). Every time you level up after
you have your dog, your dog levels up as well. For more detail, see the 
"Class-Specific Documentation/Hunter's_Dog.txt" document. For simplicity, Dogs 
start at level 3 so that they are always the same level as their owners. If your
dog is killed in action, you do not automatically get to roll another one. If 
you and your dog are separated and level up separately, your dog immediately 
levels up to match your level when you are reunited. 

    Your new dog is well-trained and responds to a variety of commands. Your dog 
listens to you and does his best to make his or her owner happy, but is not 
controlled by the player. Instead, the owner character commands the dog, and the
GM controls how the dog responds. 

Dog Personalities:



*  Loyal
*  Playful
*  Mischevious
*  Protective
*  Curious
*  Aggressive

== Class Feats ==

Tracker:
	As an Action, you can study the position and disposition of a target that
you can see, and indicate it to your Party Members that can communicate with 
you, either by being on comms with you (see the headset and similar items in
the "Items/07_Items.txt" document) or that are within 5m of you. Party Members
(including yourself) that shoot at an indicated target get a +1 to accuracy 
rolls to hit that target. A target remains indicated until they move, or for
two Rounds, whichever comes first. You also get 6 skill points in Investigation
when you take this Class Feat. 

Spotter:
	Requires that your character be level 10 and have the "Tracker" class feat. 
The first time each turn that you track an enemy that you have already tracked 
this encounter, you may do so as a Free Action instead of an Action.
	For example, let's say a Hunter is fighting an enemy robot and an enemy 
soldier. The first turn, the Hunter spends one Action to track the robot. The
second turn, the Hunter spends an Action to track the soldier. The third turn 
the Hunter tracks the robot again, but this time it is a Free Action, so the 
Hunter still has 4 Actions left on his turn. Continuing his third turn, the 
Hunter also tracks soldier. Even though the Hunter already tracked the soldier 
before, the hunter has used up his one Free Tracking Action this turn, and 
tracking the soldier again costs one Action.
	In addition, teammates now get a bonus to the range of rolls which 
critically hit on tracked enemies that they hit in accordance to their range and 
weapon type. This is accomplished by you calling out weak spots that you see on 
the target and describing shooting conditions such as the bullet drop due to 
humidity, wind speed and direction, and the coriollis effect making the bullet 
swerve. The bonus to critically hit is listed below. Note that if the chance to 
critically hit exceeds the chance to hit, it does not increase the chance to 
hit; it only garuntees that a hit will be a critical hit. If the increase in
crit range is higher than 10, that means that your teammate may crit on a roll
of 8 or 9, not just a roll of 10. 

+-------+------------+-----------------------------+
| Range | Crit bonus | Crit bonus with Long Rifles |
+-------+------------+-----------------------------+
|   R1  |      5     |              10             |
+-------+------------+-----------------------------+
|   R2  |     10     |              25             |
+-------+------------+-----------------------------+
|   R3  |     20     |             100             |
+-------+------------+-----------------------------+

Pack Hunter (I):
	You get a +2 to accuracy rolls shooting at an enemy that is being suppressed 
by one of your party members. You also get +2 to melee attack rolls against an 
enemy who is adjacent to one of your party members. Teammates who make a melee
attack against an enemy that is adjacent to you also get a +2 to their melee 
attack roll. A party member is a character that is controlled by a player other
than a DM who has played more than one encounter with your character. 

Pack Hunter (II):
	Requires that your character be level 10 and that you have Pack Hunter (I).
Your bonus for shooting at an enemy suppressed by your party member now includes
a +5% chance to critically hit. The bonus for melee for both you and your 
teammates increases to +3. 

Bushwhacker:
	You've had enough toothy critters jump out of the brush and try to bite your
head off to be pretty good with shooting things at close range. You gain 
advantage on shooting targets with your primary weapon within your weapon's R1 
range bracket. This target must also either be wielding a melee weapon or be a
non-sentient enemy that has melee attack abilities. You also get advantage on 
Perception rolls to spot cloaked or sneaking characters.

=====   GUNSLINGER   =====

	Some people hide behind their big boomsticks or fancy science tricks, but
you know that the universe doesn't separate sentients by the size of their 
hardware or how big their brain is. No, there are only two categories that one
falls into: the quick, or the dead. Some gunslingers are fast-talking scoundrels,
rouges and ne'er-do-wells. Some are the soft-spoken, hard-working long arm of 
the law. But there is one thing that all gunslingers have in common: they know 
their way around a pistol.

either use your cover's defense rating or the defense provided by this feat, you 
cannot use both. Gain +1 additional defense at level 10. This feat's defense 
bonus DOES stack with crouching or prone if you aren't behind cover. You can 
have a MAX of 5 Miss Chance Defense from this feat.
*(If dual wielding, use the larger of the two Weapon Reflexes).
	

	Choose two bonuses and one weakness. These Bonuses and Weaknesses apply only
to Pistols.

	flat-footed (you cannot be penalized for being surprised), but opponents can still 
	get surprise rounds against you.
	----------------------
	Protective Awareness - Requires a minimum Reflex of 24
	Assiduously observant, you stay aware of any attacks made against you or allies. 
	Whenever an enemy (that you can see) attempts to make an OPPORTUNITY attack on you
	or any allies, within your guns maximum range, you first gain an attack on them.
	The first time this ability is triggered on a given turn, it uses your next action.
	(But the ability only uses 1 action, even if triggered multiple times -before or during- one of your turns).
	----------------------
	Enhanced Gun-Kata [12 Nanites] -
	You are a disciple of the art of close-range gun fighting. For 1 Action, reduce 
	weapon range to 15m, and negate actions needed for the Aiming, Pumping, and Cocking 
	of a gun. Treat	your gun as if it was a CQB weapon and make 2 separate attacks 
	with it. If your gun runs out of rounds before your two attacks are done, your
	Enhanced Gun Kata ends.
	|
	|
	V
	You are a master of close-range gun fighting. Instead of 15m, gun range is 
	reduced to a max of 30m. If you run out of rounds, you may reload mid-kata 
	by passing a DC 75 DEX check. If a target dies by one of your attacks,
	gain +1 additional attack.

=====   ASSASSIN   =====
	The galaxy is a dangerous place for those who would believe their power or 
influence are limitless. The assassin lurks in the shadows, either as a lone
force of justice, or as part of a larger organization. They have rightfully 
earned the title of Galaxy's greatest Hand-to-Hand Fighters.

Class Primary Attribute: Dexterity

* Gain Skill Stealth at 10
* Gain Feat: Proficiency: Light Melee Weaponry.
* Gain Feat: Proficiency: One-handed Melee Weaponry.
* Gain bonus cloaking time when using other cloaking devices besides the Shadow Cloak.

	Assassins wear a Shadow Cloak, which allows them to become a mere silhouette.
Shadow Cloaks attempt to cloak* the assassin at all times** with a Detect DC of 
10 + skill Stealth and a moving Detect DC of 0 + skill Stealth. When in partial 
darkness or darker, the Detect and Moving Detect DC increases by 10. In the darkness,
a skilled assassin won't be seen, even when being looked at. However, in daylight,
even the most skilled assassin can be seen if their silhouette is carelessly shown.
*The Shadow Cloak does not follow typical cloaking rules, it doesn't make you as 
invisible as a more powerful cloaking device, but it does allow you to hide in 
plain sight. There is no Nanite Activation Cost, Nanite upkeep, or Cloak Turns 
as the Shadow Cloak is special item. 
**Except when attacking: you must wait until the start of the following turn 
before the cloak resumes.

	Pinned by the marksman at a time. If the target attempts to move from cover within a 180 degree field
	of view infront of you, you may roll a DC 60 Spotting skill check to hit them, as a free action. You have 
	a +1 to hit the pinned target with a firing action, for the	remainder of the encounter (even if they move
	to a new location). If the target moves, it is still considered pinned, and if the target dies or escapes 
	from the battlefield you may pin a new target. Pin can only be activated by a pinned target once per Marksman
