Shadow Walk
Roll a Knowlege [Nnaites] check, DC 50. You may teleport up to Result-50/10 
meters. You may also roll stealth after emerging at no action cost. Movement 
in this manner is considered to take an action, plus another action for the 
skill check. Monks still receive a penalty attack for performing a skill check 
in melee combat.
