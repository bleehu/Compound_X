==============================
Core Classes
==============================

	Your character starts at level 0. At level 0 you have skills, but no class, 
class feats or regular feats. At level 1 you get to select a class, and receive 
the class passives. However, you do not select a class feat until level 5. Then, 
at levels 10, 15, and 20 you can gain another class feat.

	For any listed class, if it says "Gain X Skill at 10" that means you get to 
add the X skill to your skill list. For more on Skills, see "RP / Using Skills" 
Section of Basic Rules.txt.

== Hunter's Dog ==

    When your character ascends to level 3, you receive an attack dog. Maybe 
you found the dog along your last mission, or maybe a dog was issued to you when
you returned to home base (at the GM's choice). Every time you level up after
you have your dog, your dog levels up as well as defined in the 
"Class-Specific Documentation/Hunter's_Dog.txt" document. For simplicity, Dogs 
start at level 3 so that they are always the same level as their owners. If your
dog is killed in action, you do not get to roll another one. If you and your dog
are separated and level up separately, your dog immediately levels up to match 
your level when you are reunited. 

    Your new dog is well-trained and responds to a variety of commands. Your dog 
listens to you and does his best to make his or her owner happy, but is not 
controlled by the player. Instead, the owner character commands the dog, and the
GM controls how the dog responds.

=====   GUNSLINGER   =====

	Some people hide behind their big boomsticks or fancy science tricks, but
you know that the universe doesn't separate sentients by the size of their 
hardware or how big their brain is. No, there are only two categories that one
falls into: the quick, or the dead. Some gunslingers are fast-talking scoundrels,
rouges and ne'er-do-wells. Some are the soft-spoken, hard-working long arm of 
the law. But there is one thing that all gunslingers have in common: they know 
their way around a pistol.

=====   ASSASSIN   =====
	The galaxy is a dangerous place for those who would believe their power or 
influence are limitless. The assassin lurks in the shadows, either as a lone
force of justice, or as part of a larger organization. They have rightfully 
earned the title of Galaxy's greatest Hand-to-Hand Fighters.

Starting Wealth: $1975 + 100*Luck

Passives:
* No penalty for engaging in Grappling maneuvers.
* Gain Skill Weapons - Melee at 10
* Gain bonus cloaking time when using other cloaking devices besides the Shadow Cloak.

	Assassins wear a Shadow Cloak, which allows them to become a mere silhouette.
Shadow Cloaks attempt to cloak* the assassin at all times** with a Detect DC of 
10 + skill Stealth and a moving Detect DC of 0 + skill Stealth. When in partial 
darkness or darker, the Detect and Moving Detect DC increases by 10. In the darkness,
a skilled assassin won't be seen, even when being looked at. However, in daylight,
even the most skilled assassin can be seen if their silhouette is carelessly shown.
*The Shadow Cloak does not follow typical cloaking rules, it doesn't make you as 
invisible as a more powerful cloaking device, but it does allow you to hide in 
plain sight. There is no Nanite Activation Cost, Nanite upkeep, or Cloak Turns 
as the Shadow Cloak is special item. 
**Except when attacking: you must wait until the start of the following turn 
before the cloak resumes. 

	NOTE: For more information on Cloaking and Cloaking modules, see section, 
"Cloaking" in the basic rules.

	a single use. They can be thrown* or used manually. Blades appear at the users

	*When thrown, use the stats for thrown weapon, 'Carbide Kunai' but still ignore
