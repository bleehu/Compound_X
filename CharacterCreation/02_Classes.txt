==============================
Core Classes
==============================

	Your character starts at level 0. At level 0 you have skills, but no class, 
class feats or regular feats. At level 1 you get to select a class, and receive 
the class passives. However, you do not select a class feat until level 5. Then, 
at levels 10, 15, and 20 you can gain another class feat.

	For any listed class, if it says "Gain X Skill at 10" that means you get to 
add the X skill to your skill list. For more on Skills, see "RP / Using Skills" 
Section of Basic Rules.txt.

== Class Feats ==

Blanket Fire:

    You gleefully provide cover fire over a larger area, using tools that are
best suited for such a task. When you take an Action to suppress with a 
fully automatic Heavy Weapon, you have a wider area of effect than normal. 
Instead of supressing an area of 1 to 3 meters, you suppress an area of 2 to 5
meters. 

Fire For Effect:
    
    When you lay down Heavy Suppression, you may choose to fire 14 shots instead
of 10. If you do, you are said to have "Fired For Effect." An enemy that moves
into the open of your Fire For Effect takes 4 automatic hits instead of 2. This
Class Feat cannot be taken unless your character is level 10 and has the 
"Blanket Fire" Class Feat already.

Tender Love and Care:
    
    You have an almost pathological affection for your large weapon of choice.
You keep it immaculately clean and tuned as well as you can.

    When firing an automatic weapon, the first time each Round that you would
roll a jam you instead only miss.

=====   DOCTOR   =====

    You know the secrets of life and death. The very continued existence of 
those around you depends on whether you strike the right balance between heal 
and harm. One errant twitch of your hands could mean the difference between 
saving the day or losing a friend. This is what you've been training for for 
years.

== Class Feats ==

	Adrenaline Junkie:

	You thrive on the stress of being shot at while trying to save someone's life.
You know that every breath you take could be your last, and each frantic motion
could mean the difference between sending your brother in arms to see his 
friends and family or his ancestors. You love it. Your maximum adrenaline is 
600 and you start each encounter with 240 adrenaline points instead of 200.

	Adrenaline Addict:

	"Nothing in life is so exhilarating as to be shot at without result" ~

Adrenaline Points. Requires the "Adrenaline Junkie" Doctor Class Feat.

	The Harmacist:

	Learn an extra malpractice procedure. This Class Feat can only be taken by
a level 10 Character.

=====   ENGINEER   =====

	You solve problems. For instance, you know how to stop some mean 
mutha-hubbard from tearin' you and your team a structurally superfluous new 
behind. You know how to fix engines, machines, circuits, you name it. And when 
you're not busy fixing what other people broke, you get to work on making new 
stuff. Which some knucklehead will probably, eventually, break too.

=====   HACKER   =====
	
    No system is safe. No lock is secure. No encryption is unbreakable. And
you're the reason why they're not. You're quick-thinking, curious and you have
a habit of getting into places that you shouldn't be and uncovering the secrets
that you shouldn't have seen. You have a mischievous talent for disrupting your
enemy's technology and sometimes even turning it against them.

======================================


=====   HUNTER   =====

	Unlike many of your compatriots who prefer the cold comforts of technology,
you have an affinity for the frontier. The great outdoors. Be they the 
wind-swept plains of frontier farms, the thick jungles of Tundaar or the swamps
of Trioch, you love it all. You are much more likely to know which plants won't 
kill you to eat if you get hungry, and you can make a fire by breaking the flint
rocks of Kalimba against each other. You may not be much for book learnin', but
you know that a keen eye and a choice blast from your shotgun wins the kind of
arguments you're most like to have out on the rim.

== Hunter's Dog ==

    When your character ascends to level 3, you receive an attack dog. Maybe 
you found the dog along your last mission, or maybe a dog was issued to you when
you returned to home base (at the GM's choice). Every time you level up after
you have your dog, your dog levels up as well. For more detail, see the 
"Class-Specific Documentation/Hunter's_Dog.txt" document. For simplicity, Dogs 
start at level 3 so that they are always the same level as their owners. If your
dog is killed in action, you do not automatically get to roll another one. If 
you and your dog are separated and level up separately, your dog immediately 
levels up to match your level when you are reunited. 

    Your new dog is well-trained and responds to a variety of commands. Your dog 
listens to you and does his best to make his or her owner happy, but is not 
controlled by the player. Instead, the owner character commands the dog, and the
GM controls how the dog responds. 

Dog Personalities:



*  Loyal
*  Playful
*  Mischevious
*  Protective
*  Curious
*  Aggressive

== Class Feats ==

Tracker:
	As an Action, you can study the position and disposition of a target that
you can see, and indicate it to your Party Members that can communicate with 
you, either by being on comms with you (see the headset and similar items in
the "Items/07_Items.txt" document) or that are within 5m of you. Party Members
(including yourself) that shoot at an indicated target get a +1 to accuracy 
rolls to hit that target. A target remains indicated until they move, or for
two Rounds, whichever comes first. You also get 6 skill points in Investigation
when you take this Class Feat. 

Spotter:
	Requires that your character be level 10 and have the "Tracker" class feat. 
The first time each turn that you track an enemy that you have already tracked 
this encounter, you may do so as a Free Action instead of an Action.
	For example, let's say a Hunter is fighting an enemy robot and an enemy 
soldier. The first turn, the Hunter spends one Action to track the robot. The
second turn, the Hunter spends an Action to track the soldier. The third turn 
the Hunter tracks the robot again, but this time it is a Free Action, so the 
Hunter still has 4 Actions left on his turn. Continuing his third turn, the 
Hunter also tracks soldier. Even though the Hunter already tracked the soldier 
before, the hunter has used up his one Free Tracking Action this turn, and 
tracking the soldier again costs one Action.
	In addition, teammates now get a bonus to the range of rolls which 
critically hit on tracked enemies that they hit in accordance to their range and 
weapon type. This is accomplished by you calling out weak spots that you see on 
the target and describing shooting conditions such as the bullet drop due to 
humidity, wind speed and direction, and the coriollis effect making the bullet 
swerve. The bonus to critically hit is listed below. Note that if the chance to 
critically hit exceeds the chance to hit, it does not increase the chance to 
hit; it only garuntees that a hit will be a critical hit. If the increase in
crit range is higher than 10, that means that your teammate may crit on a roll
of 8 or 9, not just a roll of 10. 

+-------+------------+-----------------------------+
| Range | Crit bonus | Crit bonus with Long Rifles |
+-------+------------+-----------------------------+
|   R1  |      5     |              10             |
+-------+------------+-----------------------------+
|   R2  |     10     |              25             |
+-------+------------+-----------------------------+
|   R3  |     20     |             100             |
+-------+------------+-----------------------------+

Pack Hunter (I):
	You get a +2 to accuracy rolls shooting at an enemy that is being suppressed 
by one of your party members. You also get +2 to melee attack rolls against an 
enemy who is adjacent to one of your party members. Teammates who make a melee
attack against an enemy that is adjacent to you also get a +2 to their melee 
attack roll. A party member is a character that is controlled by a player other
than a DM who has played more than one encounter with your character. 

Pack Hunter (II):
	Requires that your character be level 10 and that you have Pack Hunter (I).
Your bonus for shooting at an enemy suppressed by your party member now includes
a +5% chance to critically hit. The bonus for melee for both you and your 
teammates increases to +3. 

Bushwhacker:
	You've had enough toothy critters jump out of the brush and try to bite your
head off to be pretty good with shooting things at close range. You gain 
advantage on shooting targets with your primary weapon within your weapon's R1 
range bracket. This target must also either be wielding a melee weapon or be a
non-sentient enemy that has melee attack abilities. You also get advantage on 
Perception rolls to spot cloaked or sneaking characters.

=====   GUNSLINGER   =====

	Some people hide behind their big boomsticks or fancy science tricks, but
you know that the universe doesn't separate sentients by the size of their 
hardware or how big their brain is. No, there are only two categories that one
falls into: the quick, and the dead. Some gunslingers are fast-talking 
scoundrels, rogues and ne'er-do-wells. Some are the soft-spoken, hard-working 
long arm of the law. But there is one thing that all gunslingers have in common: 
they know their way around a pistol. 

Class Primary Attribute: Perception

	"Predictive Gun-Fighting": Gain Miss Chance Defense at [Reflex Save + Weapon 
Reflex*]/10 (drop the remainder). If you are behind cover, you must choose to 
either use your cover's defense rating or the defense provided by this feat, you 
cannot use both. Gain +1 additional defense at level 10. This feat's defense 
bonus DOES stack with crouching or prone if you aren't behind cover. You can

*(If dual wielding, use the larger of the two Weapon Reflexes).
	

	Choose two bonuses and one weakness. These Bonuses and Weaknesses apply only

Skill Proficiencies

Feats:

Heightened Alertness:
	Being alert comes with your level of training. Gain 10 Reflex. You cannot be 
caught flat-footed (you cannot be penalized for being surprised), but opponents 
can still get surprise rounds against you.

Protective Awareness: 
    
    Requires a minimum Reflex of 24
	
    Assiduously observant, you stay aware of any attacks made against you or 
allies. Whenever an enemy (that you can see) attempts to make an Opportunity 
Attack on you or any allies, within your guns maximum range, you first gain an 
attack on them. The first time this ability is triggered on a given turn, it 
uses your next action. (But the ability only uses 1 Action, even if triggered 
multiple times -before or during- one of your turns).

Enhanced Gun-Kata:

	You are a disciple of the art of close-range gun fighting. For 1 Turn, 
reduce maximum weapon range to 15m, and negate actions needed for the Aiming, 
Pumping, and Cocking of a gun. Treat your gun as if it was a CQB weapon and make 
2 attacks per Action with it. If your gun runs out of rounds before your turn is 
done, your Enhanced Gun Kata ends. This ability can only be used once per 
encounter.

Gun Kata Master:

	You are a master of close-range gun fighting. Instead of 15m, your maximum 
gun range is reduced to a max of 30m. If you run out of rounds, you may reload 
mid-kata by passing a DC 75 DEX check. If a target is downed by one of your 
attacks, gain +1 additional attack this turn.


=====   ASSASSIN   =====
	The galaxy is a dangerous place for those who would believe their power or 
influence are limitless. The assassin lurks in the shadows, either as a lone
force of justice, or as part of a larger organization. They have rightfully 
earned the title of Galaxy's greatest Hand-to-Hand Fighters.

Class Primary Attribute: Dexterity
Starting Wealth: $1975 + 100*Luck

Passives:
* No penalty for engaging in Grappling maneuvers.
* Gain Skill Weapons - Melee at 10
* Gain Skill Stealth at 10
* Gain Feat: Proficiency: Light Melee Weaponry.
* Gain Feat: Proficiency: One-handed Melee Weaponry.
* Gain bonus cloaking time when using other cloaking devices besides the Shadow Cloak.

	Assassins wear a "Shadow Cloak", which allows them to become a mere 
silhouette. Shadow Cloaks attempt to cloak* the assassin at all times. While
hidden with the Shadow Cloak, an enemy must pass an Awareness save of DC 10 + 
Stealth(Dex)  to see the Assassin while the Assassin is still. While the 
Assassin is moving, the DC drops to 0 + skill Stealth. The Cloak cannot provide
concealment that keeps up with the swift motions of an Assassin's attacks, and
thus fails until the the start of the Assassin's next turn after the Assassin
attacks. When in partial darkness or darker, the Detect and Moving Detect DC 
both increas by 10. Skilled assassin won't be seen in darkness, even when 
being looked at. Even the most skilled assassin will be seen in broad daylight 
with direct line of sight.

*The Shadow Cloak does not follow typical cloaking rules, it doesn't make you as 
invisible like the more powerful advanced armor cloaking devices, but it does 
allow you to hide in plain sight. There is no Nanite Activation Cost, Nanite 
upkeep, or Cloak Turns for the Shadow Cloak, as the Shadow Cloak is special item. 

	NOTE: For more information on Cloaking and Cloaking modules, see section, 
"Cloaking" in the basic rules.

Weapon Proficiencies: 
* Pistols

Armor Proficiencies:
* Cloaking
* Concealed

Skill Proficiencies:

* Weapons - Melee

Feats:

Shadowy Assassin:

	Your Cloak DCs increase by 10. Melee attacks made while in cloaking do not 
break your cloaking unless you are observed making the attack. Gain +20 base 
damage while you are in cloaking and undetected by your target.

Grapple Gremlin:
    
    While in a grapple that you control, you may use One-Handed melee weapons
or pistols normally. While in a grapple that you control, you get two Actions
instead of only one. Using a pistol to attack your grappled target uses hip fire
rules. When stealthily attacking an enemy in a grapple that you control, you get
a + 24 to Stealth(dex) rolls to keep the attack quiet.

Grapple Ghost:

    When you succeed on a grapple check against an enemy that wasn't aware of
you, you may make a Grappling Specific Action such as Shoving, Kicking, Disarm,
etc with advantage as a reaction. Victims in a grapple that you control must
pass a DC 80 Shock Save in order to make enough noise for your grapple to be
detected. So long as you control the grapple, you may make up to Three Actions
per turn, but at least one of them cannot be attacking the victim that you are
grappling. 

    Grapple Ghost requires that a Character be level 10 and have taken Grapple
Gremlin before taking it.

Et Tu Brute:
    You may make a melee attack with a One-Handed or Throwing weapon as a 
Reaction at any time as long as the following is true.

* you have the weapon already drawn
* the target is prone within melee range
* you have not already taken more than one Reaction this Round

    The attack automatically hits. This Class Feat requires that a character be
level 10 in order to take it.

== Class Feats ==

Pin Target:

	If you fire at a target that is in cover, you can choose to "Pin" the target. 
Only 1 target may be Pinned by the Marksman at a time. If the target attempts to 
move from cover within a 180 degree field of view infront of you, you may roll a 
DC 60 Spotting skill check to hit them, as a Free Action. You have a +1 to hit 
the pinned target with a firing action, for the	remainder of the encounter (even 
if they move to a new location). If the target moves, it is still considered 
pinned, and if the target dies or escapes from the battlefield you may pin a new
target. Pin can only be activated by a pinned target once per Marksman player's 
turn. Only usable with long-rifles. See the "Pinned" Condition in the 
"Conditions" document.

Multi-Pin:

	You can now Pin a maximum of half of your Perception (round down) targets at 
a time (you still have to fire at a target to pin it). +2 to hit a Pinned target 
(instead of +1). The Multi-Pin ability can be activated by a pinned target only 
once per target per Round. 

    For example, 3 Pinned targets can trigger Multi-Pin once each for a maximum 
total of 3 triggers before a marksman player's next turn). Multipin requires 
that a Character be at least level 10 and have taken the Pin Class Feat before
taking it.

Shoot to Wound:
    Instead of hitting the target in their center of mass, you aim for something
that's likely to squirt their vital fluids all over the place. While this will
be much less likely to down the target immediately, it increases their chance
of bleeding out over time.

    At any time before you fire a long rifle, you may declare your intent to
"Shoot to Wound." If you do, you must pass a DC 35 Weapons - Long Rifle(PER)
skill check. If you fail, you fire a regular shot. If you succeed, then your 
attack deals 20 less damage and applies 3 Bleed tokens to the target. See 
"Bleeding" in the "Conditions" document for more on Bleeding.

Disrupting Shot:
    Instead of hitting the target in their center of mass, you aim for the 
equipment that they're using or the stinger of the alien that you're fighting.
It's not as lethal as hitting them where it hurts, but it'll make it harder for
them to do their job. 

    At any time before you fire a long rifle, you may declare your intent to
"Fire to Disrupt." If you do, you must pass a DC 45 Weapons - Long Rifles(PER)
skill check. If you fail, you fire a regular shot. If you succeed, you hit the
target where it would disrupt their operations most. The target gains the 
"Disrupted" condition until they succeed on a Shock Save of DC 80 or for 3 
Rounds, whichever is first. Then they are able to retrieve or remodulate 
whatever you blasted. If you critically succeed, there is a chance that you will
permanently destroy their hardware and they will be disrupted for the remainder
of the encounter, depending on DM discretion.
