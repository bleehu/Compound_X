	only have to pass a DC 50 Knowledge [Nanite] check.

	Shadow Walk -
	Roll a Knowledge[Nanites] check, DC 50. You may teleport up to Result-50/10

	in this manner is considered to take an action, plus another action for the 
	skill check. Monks still receive a penalty attack for performing a skill check 
	in melee combat.
