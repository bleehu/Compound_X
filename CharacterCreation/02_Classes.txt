==============================
Core Classes
==============================

	Your character starts at level 0. At level 0 you have skills, but no class, 
class feats or regular feats. At level 1 you get to select a class, and receive 
the class passives. However, you do not select a class feat until level 5. Then, 
at levels 10, 15, and 20 you can gain another class feat.

	For any listed class, if it says "Gain X Skill at 10" that means you get to 
add the X skill to your skill list. For more on Skills, see "RP / Using Skills" 
Section of Basic Rules.txt.

hardware or how big their brain is. No, there are only two categories that one
falls into: the quick, or the dead. Some gunslingers are fast-talking scoundrels,
rouges and ne'er-do-wells. Some are the soft-spoken, hard-working long arm of 
the law. But there is one thing that all gunslingers have in common: they know 
their way around a pistol.

=====   ASSASSIN   =====
	The galaxy is a dangerous place for those who would believe their power or

	Assassins wear a Shadow Cloak, which allows them to become a mere silhouette.
Shadow Cloaks attempt to cloak* the assassin at all times** with a Detect DC of 
10 + skill Stealth and a moving Detect DC of 0 + skill Stealth. When in partial 
darkness or darker, the Detect and Moving Detect DC increases by 10. In the darkness,
a skilled assassin won't be seen, even when being looked at. However, in daylight,
even the most skilled assassin can be seen if their silhouette is carelessly shown.
*The Shadow Cloak does not follow typical cloaking rules, it doesn't make you as 
invisible as a more powerful cloaking device, but it does allow you to hide in 
plain sight. There is no Nanite Activation Cost, Nanite upkeep, or Cloak Turns 
as the Shadow Cloak is special item. 
**Except when attacking: you must wait until the start of the following turn 
before the cloak resumes.
