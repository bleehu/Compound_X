Species in Compound X
==============================

	The solar systems, space stations and nebulae of the Compound X universe are
host a dizzying variety of sentient species. Each with their own societies, 
customs, beliefs, architectures, technologies, languages and fashions. 

	Not all sentient species in Compound X can be played as a Player Character
within the core rules. What's more, all of the playable species have some level
of individuality and some level of self-awareness. The Species that you do pick
to play will give you some cues for your character's backstory as well as some
hints on how to role-play as your character. If this is your first time playing
a Role Playing Game, or if you're not very interested in the role-playing part
of the game, then we encourage you to play as a Human or Terran. They are the
easiest to relate to and tend to be easier to play as. 

===== Choosing a Species =====

	Choosing a species is one of the first steps to making a character. Which
species you are will affect how other species interact with you, and will help
decide your final stats. Your character must have a species and can only have
one species. Will you be an adventersome young human, exploring what become of
the planet that your species came from? Or will you be an fearsome and graceful
Tundari from the jungles of Tundaar? Or perhaps you'll be made of cold metal and
science and will play as a Security Drone constructed within the Compound X 
itself. Only you can decide!

== Traits ==

== Sub-Species ==

	Each species is split into subgroups, which help to differentiate characters 
from different backgrounds. 
	
	Humans are generally differentiated based on their home star system. Those
who have stayed in the Sol system have been forced to endure the inhospitable conditions
there and have survived in equal parts due to their stubbornness and ingenuity, while 
those seeking refuge elsewhere in the galaxy have been shaped by the difficulty in 
creating colonies on dangerous worlds.
	
	Tundari generally belong to one of several large clans. Each clan is distinguished
from the others by its geographical location and culture. The clans have each adapted 
to their environments to the point that an outsider could be forgiven for not realizing 
that the Tundari were just one species.

	ECSC Security Drones are purpose-built machines. Each Series of Drone has the 
same chassis, but they all are created for a certain role. Many Drones are built for 
increased resiliance in dangerous environenments such as the colonies of humanity, while 
others are meant to do manual labor tasks that no other race could do without heavy machinery.

	Opaleites are quite varied, even in the same area. They evolved many defensive traits
to keep them alive in the hostile waters of Trioch II, which they continue to use to their
advantage to this day.
