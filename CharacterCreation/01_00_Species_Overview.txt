Species in Compound X
==============================

	The solar systems, space stations and nebulae of the Compound X universe are
host a dizzying variety of sentient species. Each with their own societies, 
customs, beliefs, architectures, technologies, languages and fashions. 

	Not all sentient species in Compound X can be played as a Player Character
within the core rules. What's more, all of the playable species have some level
of individuality and some level of self-awareness. The Species that you do pick
to play will give you some cues for your character's backstory as well as some
hints on how to role-play as your character. If this is your first time playing
a Role Playing Game, or if you're not very interested in the role-playing part
of the game, then we encourage you to play as a Human or Terran. They are the
easiest to relate to and tend to be easier to play as. 

===== Choosing a Species =====

	Choosing a species is one of the first steps to making a character. Which
species you are will affect how other species interact with you, and will help
decide your final stats. Your character must have a species and can only have
one species. Will you be an adventersome young human, exploring what become of
the planet that your species came from? Or will you be an fearsome and graceful
Tundari from the jungles of Tundaar? Or perhaps you'll be made of cold metal and
science and will play as a Security Drone constructed within the Compound X 
itself. Only you can decide!

Species Overview

===== Humans =====

    Humans are bipedal organic mammals. They origionally hail from a formerly
blue-green planet called Earth, and now make up the majority of the Terran 
Empire. Humans are hearty, enterprising and resourceful. 

    Humans can excell at any class. You could be a grizzled human soldier who's
seen more than their fair share of combat. Or you could be the charismatic 
gunslinging galatic bounty hunter who always gets their man, but rarely gets the
girl. You could be the intuitive human engineer who takes care of her drones 
like they were her beloved pets. Or the recent med student grad who's a whiz
combat medic with a crush on another party member, if only he could get over his
stutter. 

    Play a human if you'd like the roleplaying to be easy, or if you want to
play up another part of your character. Humans are pretty easy to play for 
first-time RPG players or Compound X players.
