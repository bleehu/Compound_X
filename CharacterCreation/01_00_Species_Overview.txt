Species in Compound X
==============================

	The solar systems, space stations and nebulae of the Compound X universe are
host to a dizzying variety of sentient species. Each with their own societies, 
customs, beliefs, architectures, technologies, languages and fashions. 

	Not all sentient species in Compound X can be played as a Player Character
within the core rules. What's more, all of the playable species have some level
of individuality and some level of self-awareness. The Species that you do pick
to play will give you some cues for your character's backstory as well as some
hints on how to role-play as your character. If this is your first time playing
a Role Playing Game, or if you're not very interested in the role-playing part
of the game, then we encourage you to play as a Human or Terran. They are the
easiest to relate to and tend to be easier to play as. 

===== Choosing a Species =====

	Choosing a species is one of the first steps to making a character. Which
species you are will affect how other species interact with you, and will help
decide your final stats. Your character must have a species and can only have
one species. Will you be an adventersome young human, exploring what become of
the planet that your species came from? Or will you be an fearsome and graceful
Tundari from the jungles of Tundar? Or perhaps you'll be made of cold metal and
science and will play as a Security Drone constructed within the Compound X 
itself. Only you can decide!

== Traits ==

    When creating your character, you will get the chance to pick two species
traits. The pool of traits that you can pick from includes your available species
traits, as well as any available traits from your sub-species.You can choose to 
have two traits from your species traits list, two traits from your subspecies 
list, or one each from your species and subspecies list.

== Sub-Species ==

	Each species is split into subgroups, which help to differentiate characters 
from different backgrounds. 
	
	Humans are generally differentiated based on their home star system. Those
who have stayed in the Sol system have been forced to endure the inhospitable conditions
there and have survived in equal parts due to their stubbornness and ingenuity, while 
those seeking refuge elsewhere in the galaxy have been shaped by the difficulty in 
creating colonies on dangerous worlds.
	
	Tundari generally belong to one of several large clans. Each clan is distinguished
from the others by its geographical location and culture. The clans have each adapted 
to their environments to the point that an outsider could be forgiven for not realizing 
that the Tundari were just one species.

	ECSC Security Drones are purpose-built machines. Each Series of Drone has the 
same chassis, but they all are created for a certain role. Many Drones are built for 
increased resiliance in dangerous environenments such as the colonies of humanity, while 
others are meant to do manual labor tasks that no other race could do without heavy machinery.

	Opaleites are quite varied, even in the same area. They have differentiated into 
several families that specialized in different defensive traits to keep them alive alive 
in the hostile waters of Trioch II, which they continue to use to theiradvantage to this day.

Species Overview
==============================

===== Humans =====

    Humans are bipedal mammals. They origionally hail from a formerly blue-green 
planet called Earth, and now make up the majority of the Terran Empire. Humans 
are hearty, enterprising and resourceful. 

    Humans can excel at any class. You could be a grizzled human soldier who has
seen more than their fair share of combat. Or you could be the charismatic 
gunslinging galatic bounty hunter who always gets their man, but rarely gets the
girl. You could be the intuitive human engineer who takes care of her drones 
like they were her beloved pets. Or the recent medical school graduate who's a 
whiz combat medic with a crush on another party member, if only he could get 
over his stutter.

    Play a human if you'd like the roleplaying to be easy, or if you want to
play up another part of your character. Humans are pretty easy to play for 
first-time RPG players or Compound X players. 

===== Tundari =====

    Tundari are fur-covered bipedal organic mammals. They have whiskers and a 
tail, each of varying lengths. Tundari come from the violently alive planet of
Tundar. Tundari as a species are fierce, cunning, curious and playful. 

    Tundari can dominate as any class. For example, you could play as the silent
padfooted assassin, whose enemies never knew she was there until it was too 
late. You could be the big teddy bear of a beserker who is quick to trust and 
quicker to tear apart any foe who would put their party in peril. You could be 
the curious combat medic who sometimes gets preocuppied with the science behind 
the sights that the galaxy has to show. 

    Play a Tundari if you want to give yourself a challenge either tactically or 
in roleplay. Tactically, Tundari have slightly more maneuverability and slightly 
less survivability than the other species. In roleplay, it can be very fun to 
play something other than a human, but something that is still a mammal. You 
play a human every day, after all!

===== Security Drone =====

    Security Drones are bipedal, self-aware robots. Originally developed in the 
Compound X experimentation laboratory as a military project, their design and 
construction has since spread into the larger Terran Imperial corporate scene. 
Drone personalities tend to be dutiful, conscientious, stubborn, and unsubtle.

    Drones can claim victory as any almost any class. You could be the 
weapon-loaded Specialist who knows how to deal with obstacles, or the 21st 
century nightmare Hacker with an intimiate understanding of AI operating systems, 
or perhaps the top-notch Pilot that literally becomes one with their vehicles.

    Play a Security Drone if you want to roleplay from within a set of constraints 
that are better defined and more resistant to change than most species. Drone 
traits tend toward durability and observation, making them strong defensive 
presences.

===== Opaleite =====

    Opaleites are amphibious organic aliens that have a sense of adventure and
fierce loyalty to their clans. They can breathe above and below water. Some have
scales that resist bullets and others have scales that can change color or 
bioluminesce. Opaleites' unique resperatory system doesn't handle smoke or tear
gas well, and they take extra damage when subjected to such effects. 

    Opaleites are typically pretty easy to play and are fun to roleplay. Their
unique abilities often revolve around puzzle solving or mobility, rather than
combat. An Opaleite often sees the world from a different perspective than their
landlocked party members, and that can lead to clever insights or comical 
exchanges. Tactically, their affinity for water can help lend them and their 
team an advantage on certain battlefields. A good Opaleite is a great addition 
to almost any party!
