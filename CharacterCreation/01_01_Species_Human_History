Terran History
==============================

Human history has always been fraught with strife, the future is no exception.

==============================
2157
==============================

Scientists on Earth began tracking anomolies on the fringes of the solar system,
ranging from energy surges to minor gravitational fluctuations. Meteorite activity
on Earth increased by nearly three times the norm. 
Most of the meteorites that landed intact were of natural formation; however, it 
was soon discovered that there were other things among the meteorites. As the year
went on, as more of these odd meteorites were found, it seemed there could be
no other explaination than these strange chunks were crafted by some extra-
terrestrial lifeform. 
There were two distinct types that fell to Earth, leading humanity to believe 
that the anomolies they had detected were the result of two warring alien
species. Many were thrilled at the sudden knowledge that there was more life
among the stars, but as the debris fell and the deep-space probes sent data
that warned of highly irratiated areas of space, humanity decided to remain
silent. 
Humanity learned what they could from the pieces of debris they collected from 
the solar system; as the year went on, the debris pieces became larger and more
frequent. Many took to living under makeshift asteroid shields, and the population
became desperate for relief. 

==============================
2159
==============================

From the remaining vantage points on Earth, and what little probes are left in 
the solar system, the war has only gotten worse. The Earth is terribly scarred, 
and the moon has only been able to protect it to a degree. Tides are long and 
incredibly high, making coastal regions uninhabitable. 

In March of 2159, a blast of plasmic energy careened past the Earth and directly
into Sol I. This caused immediate major solar activity, raising the heat of the 
Sun and ushuring in a new era of freguent geomagnetic storms and solar flares.
The more debris that was caught in the Sun's gravitational well, the more the 
storms increased in frequency. 

Over the next decades Earth suffered massive earthquakes. New volcanic chains 
were born when plates were ripped apart and shoved together on the other side. 
The planet began tilting further on its axis with every rotation around the 
Sun.
During this time, humanity banded together for the first time in fifty years.
The humans knew their planet was dying, and they worked hard to pool every
resource towards moving on. The colony established on Mars 50 years prior 
was far too small, and far too close to be of much use. Mars had suffered its
own problems over the years, and there was little hope of their surviving, let 
alone any hope for aid. 

==============================
2203
==============================

Using what technology they could salvage from the alien debris, the humans 
developed early stages of faster-than-light travel and began their tests for 
proper terraforming. In the summer of 2203, the makeshift fleet of colony
ships left the planet with the majority of what remained of humanity.


==============================
2455
==============================

Three generations on the colony ship found the Terrans at their final
destination: Kepler III. 
The terraforming process took nearly fifty years just to make the 
planet habitable, and an additional twenty-six to make it comfortable.


==============================
2531
==============================

Named Copernia, the new Terran homeworld begins to thrive. 


==============================
2550
==============================

Terraforming of Copernia's two moons Ferona and Ceres begins. 
First Contact with Tundari.

==============================
2627
==============================

First Contact with Opalites.

==============================
2784
==============================

The Terran expansion projects across Terran space are thriving. There
are more terraforming projects than any one corporation can count, and
meeting alien species is almost policy. 
The nearby Kepler planets, Phuis and Galilei are well on their way to 
becoming their own populus planets. 

The Terrans are run by a corporate oligarchy, which, while not perfect, 
has served humanity well thus far. 

There are occasional trips to Earth now that the trip takes months rather
than decades. The planet is virtually unrecognizable from the Old-Earth 
maps in the terran files. Perhaps unsurprisingly, those who stayed behind 
adapted to their new, harsher environments and flourish despite their
circumstances. 

The Hess Research Outpost is five years into it's ongoing mission to study
the war that changed Earth forever, and watch for any expansion on the 
massive radiation cloud it created. 

The Martian Colony has not been heard from since their last recorded 
transmission in 2201, and there have been no successful reconnaissance
missions since.
