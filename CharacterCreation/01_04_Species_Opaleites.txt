Opaleites
==============================

  Opaleites are an organic amphibious species that 

===== Appearance/Anatomy =====

    Opaleites have a nervous system, heart, brain, and digestive tract that are 
functionally similar to most other known sentient bipeds. The largest distinction
is their respiratory system. Two sets of gills, one at the neck, and one just 
above the hip, the second set is often closed, allowing speech and other 
underwater sounds. Keeping the second set closed does hurt an Opaleite's speed 
while swimming. They are also used to drain the lungs when making the switch 
from water to air.

    They have two sets of eyes, one set of highly-developed, forward-facing eyes, 
particularly well suited for seeing underwater, and the other is a set placed
above and behind the first that face in the general upward direction. They are 
simple, compound eyes that only see contrasting shapes. They are alike in 
appearence to the opal gemstone, which is where this species gets their 
Galactic Common name.

    Male and female differences are less obvious than their mammalian counterparts. 
Male Opaleites have larger fins than their female counterparts. Female fins
are fairly evenly ridged, while males have a long spine on the end of each
fin. Size, color, and patterns may also differ, but these are not dependant
on the sex of an individual. 

Types:
*  Biological
*  Scaled Amphibian
*  Varied Diets: Obligate Carnivores to Strict Herbivores
*  Cold-Blooded

===== Society =====

    The Opaleites are one of the discordant societies that the Terrans have come
across so far. Moving from Trioch II to Trioch IV briefly united the clans 
to save their species, but rapidly descended back into infighting. The clans 
are heavily separated by subspecies, primarily informed by diet. However, many 
of the subspecies within food groups do not agree either. 

    They are primarily a clan-based society. There is more emphasis on being a 
part of the group of individuals ( you were born in than there is on blood 
relatives, in general. 

===== Languages: Various =====

    All Opaleite languages follow a similar vocal pattern structure, but dialects
vary greatly enough that some schools struggle to understand each other.

Vocal - Underwater:
    This portion of the language is meant exclusively for long-range 
communication underwater. It features series of clicks, whistles, and song-like 
long tones to covery general ideas, locations, and strategies.

Vocal - Above Water:
    Very similar to the speech used by many other sentient species, Opaleites have
a tonal vocalized language that is used to communicate above water and at
close range underwater. It features long vowels, hard consonants, and tonal hums. 
This aspect of their communication is much more suited to exploring and 
explaining complex thoughts, feelings, and plans. 
It is sing-song both above and beneath the water, but the sounds are often
harsh-sounding to an ear accustomed to Terran-based Common.

Signing - Above & Below:  
    Commonly used beneath the water, hand signing and fin signals help convey 
complex ideas in near-silence underwater. Many schools have their own versions
of this method of communication, making it easy to talk amongst themselves
while in mixed company.

Other:
    Some schools of Opaleites have additional ways of communicating. These are 
often non-verbal, having to do with that school's specific anatomy. 
Colorchanging and Bioluminescence are two examples of this.

==== Passives ====

Waterbreathing:
    As amphibians, Opaleites can breath both above and beneath the water. The 
complexity necessary to acheive this in a species their size does have a few 
drawbacks, however. [Can breath underwater. -10 to save rolls involviving smoke or gaseous attacks]
   
Compound Eyes:
   While Opaleites have two sets of eyes, their visual aquity above water is not 
as good as a species that lives above water full time. On the other hand, it is 
very hard to sneak up on an Opaleite in any decent light. [-10 to general 
perception rolls above water, can detect movement from above and sides without 
turning head]

===== Available Traits =====

Dark Vision:
    The water on any given planet is not always brightened heavily by the sun. 
Acclimated to darker waters, many Opalites can see as if in normal light in
low light conditions.

==============================
Opaleite Sub-Species
==============================


===== Mendars =====

Size: Medium
Home System: Trioch IV

Stats: +2 CHA

Appearance: 
   Thin and brightly colored, these Opaleites sport a variety of colors
   and patterns. 
   
== Available Traits ==

Colorful:
   People are attracted by colors, they naturally flock toward brilliant scales.
   They are the perfect disraction, bringing in the attention of those
   in the area. 
   [Gain advantage on a Performance[CHA] check while attempting to distract
   a either a group or single individual. Mechanical species and blind/eyeless
   individuals are immune to this effect.]


===== Condrichs =====

Size: Large
Home System: Trioch IV

Stats: +1 STR, +1 FOR

Appearance:
   Thick, cartilaginous scales cover a wide skeletal structure. 


== Available Traits ==

Tough Skinned:

    The chitinous interlocking scales of the Condrichs are surprisingly adept at
naturally dispersing the impact from bullets, toothy predators and melee weapons
alike. The scales do have their limits though.  They don't perform quite as well 
as modern body armor machined for the purpose, and some of the more vulnerable
parts of Condrich anatomy such as the face and gills aren't bulletproof. 

    If a Condrich either goes without armor or wears a rig that doesn't provide
any protection, then the Condrich uses an armor called "Natural Armor" which has
80% coverage, an APL of 1, an Armor Strength of 40, and no movement restriction.
They have however much mag space any other clothing they wear provides. If the
Condrich does wear armor, they get an Armor Strength bonus of 20 to whichever
armor that they wear.
    
===== Sea Devils =====

    
Size: Medium
Home System: Trioch IV

Stats: +2 DEX

Appearance:
    Similar in size to the Mendars, the Sea Devils, or Samek in the Opaleite
tongue, are named for their inherenet ability to bioluminesce. 

== Available Traits ==

Light Dance:
  
    Sea Devils can harness their ability to bioluminesce to distract and 
confuse enemies. Used in conjunction with darkness and quick movement, an
experienced individual can alternate lighting scales from tip to tail to 
misdirect an enemy.

   Under low-light or darker, may use this ability while evading enemy
fire to give you a +1 to hit. Enemies may roll Awareness vs 60 to see
throught the deception. May also be used to attempt to distract an
individual away from your teammates; enemy awareness vs. Acro[DEX] or Alth[DEX].
   
Deep Glow:

    Even those with Low-light vision cannot see in total darkness without
aid. A Sea Devil may concentrate on their bioluminescent scales, brightening
them to a leve that will allow others to see better in the darkness.
    
    The area 5m around you is increased two light levels, an additional
5m is increased by a single light level. +1 to enemies trying to hit you. 
This takes a great deal of energy; it will take twice as long to perform
actions in combat while this ability is active, and any injury will end
the ability. Can be used up to 10 minutes before needing a short rest;
up to 30 minutes a day.
