==============================
Opaleites
==============================

===== Society =====

The Opaleites are one of the discordant societies that the Terrans have come
across so far. Moving from Trioch II to Trioch IV briefly united the clans 
to save their species, but rapidly descended back into infighting. The clans 
are heavily separated by subspecies, primarily informed by diet. However, many 
of the subspecies within food groups do not agree either. 

They are primarily a clan-based society. There is more emphasis on being a part
of the group of individuals ( you were born in than there is on blood relatives,
in general. 


===== Anatomy =====

Opaleites have a nervous system, heart, brain, and digestive tract that are 
functionally similar to most other known sentient bipeds. The largest distinction
is their respiratory system. Two sets of gills, one at the neck, and one just above
the hip, the second set is often closed, allowing speech and other underwater
sounds. Keeping the second set closed does hurt an Opaleite's speed while
swimming. They are also used to drain the lungs when making the switch from 
water to air.

They have two sets of eyes, one set of highly-developed, forward-facing eyes, 
particularly well suited for seeing underwater, and the other is a set placed
above and behind the first that face in the general upward direction. They are 
simple, compound eyes that only see contrasting shapes. They are alike in 
appearence to the opal gemstone, which is where this species gets their 
Galactic Common name.

Male and female differences are less obvious than their mammalian counterparts. 
Male Opaleites have larger fins than their female counterparts. Female fins
are fairly evenly ridged, while males have a long spine on the end of each
fin. Size, color, and patterns may also differ, but these are not dependant
on the sex of an individual.

===== Languages: Various =====

All Opaleite languages follow a similar vocal pattern structure, but dialects
vary greatly enough that some schools struggle to understand each other.

Vocal - Underwater
  This portion of the language is meant exclusively for long-range communication
  underwater. It features series of clicks, whistles, and song-like long tones to
  covery general ideas, locations, and strategies.

Vocal - Above Water
  Very similar to the speech used by many other sentient species, Opaleites have
  a tonal vocalized language that is used to communicate above water and at
  close range underwater. It features long vowels, hard consonants, and tonal hums. 
  This aspect of their communication is much more suited to exploring and 
  explaining complex thoughts, feelings, and plans. 
  It is sing-song both above and beneath the water, but the sounds are often
  harsh-sounding to an ear accustomed to Terran-based Common.

Signing - Above & Below  
  Commonly used beneath the water, hand signing and fin signals help convey 
  complex ideas in near-silence underwater. Many schools have their own versions
  of this method of communication, making it easy to talk amongst themselves
  while in mixed company.

Other
  Some schools of Opaleites have additional ways of communicating. These
  are often non-verbal, having to do with that school's specific anatomy.
  Colorchanging and Bioluminescence are two examples of this.

==== Passives ====

* Waterbreathing
    As amphibians, Opaleites can breath both above and beneath the water. The 
    complexity necessary to acheive this in a species their size does have a few 
    drawbacks, however. 
    [Can breath underwater. -10 to save rolls involviving smoke or gaseous attacks]
   
* Compound Eyes
   While Opaleites have two sets of eyes, their visual aquity above water is
   not as good as a species that lives above water full time. On the other hand,
   it is very hard to sneak up on an Opaleite in any decent light.
   [-10 to general perception rolls above water, can detect movement from above
   and sides without turning head]
