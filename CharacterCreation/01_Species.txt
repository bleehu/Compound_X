Human
==============================

===== Society =====

    Humans are the most common sentient species in ECSC. While most belong to the 
empire that is centered near their home planet, many other cultures and sub 
cultures dot the surrounding systems ranging from corporations to patriarchies 
to pirate anarchies.

Tundari
==============================

===== Homeworld: Tundaaari =====

    A dry, searingly hot planet covered in planes and deserts. 70% of the planet 
is covered in water. The planet's axis of rotation is more or less upright 
relative to its binary star system. The North pole points more towards the suns, 
and as such is a cooked wasteland, while the south pole is left in a more 
temperate, jungle climate. 90% of the annual rainfall on the planet occurs on 
this jungly southern continent.

===== Native Species: Tundarin =====

    This Feline-esque species is covered in a soft, short fur ranging in many 
colors, from browns, to oranges, blacks, grays, etc. And a multitude of patterns
(striped, splotched, dotted, etc.). They have whiskers, and very sharp teeth. 
Their eyesight is very good, and they have low-light vision. Their build is 
generally more slender and graceful, but there have been bulkier Tundarin 
observed.

===== Society: =====

    Tribal with leading council of elders.

    The planet as a whole is unified under the banner of space exploration. 
There are many nation-states coming from historical tribes. Each nation-state is 
led by a council of elders, and a head elder is elected from each council to sit 
in on the grand council which overlooks issues on a planet-wide scale. They are 
hunters by nature, with a close tie to nature. Their cities typically blend in 
with the environment, whether it be large tree cities or hanging cliff cities.

    They typically believe in spiritualism, and their level of science has been 
brought about by their religious leaders. Science is seen as a result of their
religion, rather than an explanation of it. This being the case, science is 
well taught and understood by most all Tundarin, and higher tier and newer 
prototype devices are revered as religious artifacts.
As far as the war goes, the Tundarin have been more peaceful towards humans, 
and have recently opened trade routes with the humans. While uncommon, 
Tundarin have been known to mingle with humans on occasion. Those who do have 
an understanding of Human Basic.

Detachment A Security Drone
==============================

===== Society ===== 

    Slave soldiers. Squad families.
    Security Drones are specialized drones that have been granted a greater AI 
capacity to learn and think independently. They are native to ECSC Compound X 
experimentation laboratory.

===== Anatomy =====

    They have a steel reinforced frame, and are usually armor plated. The 
coloration of plating can range anywhere in the natural colors and camouflages,
or Flat Grey, or Flat Black. They have a single ocular sensor situated on a 
smallish square head. They generally stand somewhere in the 6 foot to 7 foot 
range, and weigh between 400 and 700 pounds.

==============================
Multipurpose Drone
==============================

===== Society ===== 

    Multipurpose drones were first constructed by Humans, and later
made by both Humans and other Multipurpose Drones. There are a 
variety of opinions defining race relations between Humans and
MultiPDs. Some Drones feel they are superior to Humans because
they don't age and don't need to sleep. Many see themselves as
downtrodden and beholden to their creators. Still others work
and recreate with Humans productively and peacefully. 

===== Anatomy =====

    The cognitive matrix of a MultiPD works as its brain and
comes with an empathic multiplexer for emotions and the dynamic
learning compositor for sentient learning. Despite the range of
emotional development a Drone can achieve, their lack of a face
has given them a reputation among some organics as being cold and
calculated.

Type:       Cybernetic

    The Multipurpose Drone learns 5 points more skills on each level up.

Hovering: 
    Multipurpose drones can't fly, but they do move by hovering over the terrain 
below them. They don't take penalties for difficult terrain and can hover over 
water. 

Faceless: 
    Opponents counter persuasion, deception, bluff checks with Repair checks 
instead of insight/charisma checks. 

Robotic: 
    Does not need to eat, breath, or sleep. Must spend 6 hours to recharge after 
a 24 hour period. this can be done via a self-contained reactor. Not affected by
mind-influence, susceptible to hack attempts.

    Electrical Damage deals an additional 50% damage.

==============================
Cyborg
==============================

===== Society ===== 

    Cybernetics advanced rapidly over the last 200 years, and it is not 
uncommon to see Cyborgs walking amongst crowds. Most of society looks down on 
their augmented brethren, and in some places they are outcasts completely. Be 
warned if you take this race, you will be discriminated against at some point.

Type: Enhanced Organic.
Size: Medium
Speed: Normal+
Starting Stat Points: 40
Stat Modifiers: See Below

===== Racial Traits =====

== Mechanical Augmentation ==

    Pick any three augments (you may take a single augment no more than 2 times, 
or a combination of multiple augments. For example Occular Augment and Speed 
Geared Fine Motor Controls II might help a melee fighter increase both damage 
and hit chance.):

* Ocular Augmentation: +1 Perception, IR Vision 20m.
* Enhanced Speed: +1 movement.
* Enhanced Strength: +1 STR, metal arms, legs, or both.
* Neural Implant: +1 Intelligence.
* Speed Geared Fine Motor Controls: +1 DEX, no augment to movement speed.
* Skeletal Support Structure: +1 FORT.
* Implanted Weapon: See Below
* Integrated multi-tool: See Below
* Internal Reinforcing: Critical Damage threshold +5, +5 base health.
* External Reinforcing: 5 DR passive, potential for RP abilities.

    Once at level 3, and every 5 levels thereafter a Cyborg may purchase an 
additional augment at the cost of $2000. They must see a cybernetics expert to
have this augment installed.

== Implanted Weapon ==

    Pick a pistol from the basic weapons list. This pistol is implanted in a 
limb. You may manipulate your limb to use this weapon at the cost of 1 action. 
While the weapon is out, that limb does not operate at its normal capacities. 
Hands would not grasp, legs would not superbly support you, etc. Subtract the 
price of the weapon from your class starting money. The weapon can be upgraded 
to another pistol with a DC 25 Biomechanics check, or a DC 50 Mechanics check. 
It can be upgraded to any CQB weapon with a DC 50 Biomechanics or DC 75 
Mechanics check.

== Integrated Multi-tool ==

    Your fingers hide a basic toolkit, including low-speed motorized 
screwdrivers, soldering iron, wrenches, quantum spanner, toothpick, pliers, 
sharp edge, lock pick, etc.

===== Weaknesses =====

    Cyborgs share all weaknesses with their base race, generally humans. They 
additionally are weak against electric damage taking an extra 50% damage.(10
damage would become 15). They are also susceptible to hacking, although they 
would not come under control, they would merely loose the use of their 
augmentations and any affected limbs. DC 80 Hack check.

==============================
Opaleite
==============================

===== Anatomy =====

    Opaleites are so named by the humans who encountered them for the way the 
light diffracts in their large irises, giving the impression of an opal. A 
wide-eyed amphibious species that prefers to live entirely in the water. They 
come in a diverse set of body types and colors depending on where they live and 
which family they come from. The carry a double set of gills, one set in the 
neck and one set beneath the lungs that can be closed and sealed, much like the 
ears and nostrils of aquatic mammals. Unlike their mammalian counterparts, these 
people can function both underwater and above water. When in the water, the 
lungs merely act as a bypass for the water running through the gills and gives 
it a way to exit; while outside of the water, the gill flaps close and the lungs 
function as mammals'’' do. They are incredibly sensitive to sunlight, and burn 
very easily when not in the water. 

===== Homeworld: Trioch II =====

not in the water.

    Native to the once Ocean planet Trioch II, these beings evolved to the 
changing of their planet as a massive solar flare from their star shifted the 
magnetic fields holding in the atmosphere were shaken and ultimately disrupted, 
causing the oceans to begin evaporating. With their oceans slowly dissipating 
through the leak in the atmosphere, they have begun migrating to the nearby 

    Trioch IV, also mostly oceanic, which is out of immediate danger from the 
star. Now, they live in both the oceans and the well-shaded estuaries on Trioch 
IV. A few stubborn stragglers remain on Trioch II, which is slowly becoming a 
sandy, dry wasteland with very little atmosphere. 

    Trioch II is now a place for venturing archaeologists to come and 
investigate the way the Opaleites used to live. 

===== Racial Bonuses =====

* Waterbreathing
* +1 base FORT
* +10 to reflex rolls
* -10 to perception rolls above water.

    Due to their rapid evolution, Opaleites have a much easier time adjusting to 
the physical obstacles presented to them. Sensitivity to Smoke and Gasesous 
attacks. -20 to save rolls involving these attacks. 

===== Subraces =====

== Seadevil ==

* +1 DEX
* -1 FOR
* -1 CHA
* Low-light vision.

Ability: Bioluminescence - Once per day.[Is an available skill] Persuade a 
being, sentient or not, that you are trustworthy. Victim must roll a will-save 
50+(Siren points). Effect is dissipated when victims eyes are covered or lose 
sight of you. This takes a tremendous amount of effort and you take a -10 
penalty if tired or bloodied. This ability will temporarily scramble a robot's 
visual cortex, but they can adjust rapidly.

== Chondrich ==

* +1 STR
* +1 FOR
* -1 CHA

Passive: Tough Skinned 

    Natural Armor protects you in a firefight. +10 armor coverage, + 5+(FOR/2) 
Damage reduction. Armor piercing rounds ignore these bonuses. 

Passive: Large

    You are larger than your counterparts and are thus easier to hit, -5 DC on 
any chance to hit you.

== Mendar ==

* +2 CHA
* -2 to chosen stats.

Ability: Colorful!

    People like you, they naturally flock toward your brilliant scales. You have 
the ability to either wow or calm a crowd. You are the perfect distraction; 
bring in the attention of those in the area. Victims must roll a will-save of 
40+Siren Points. Droids are immune to this effect.

== Tetra ==

* +1 FOR
* -1 STR
* -1 DEX

Ability: Burst of Speed

    [Once per encounter] You are not fast, except when you or your schoolmates 
are in danger. Moving faster than many think possible, you dart forward, moving 
at 2*DEX for one action. Max 2 Actions. At the end of the dash, take a free 
melee strike at an enemy within range.

Ability: Toxic Poof 

    Your particularly stretchy scales allow for a rapid expansion of your body, 
protruding the toxic spines that otherwise lay harmlessly under your scales. You 
expand to twice your size and anything that touches you takes 10 dmg +5 poison 
dmg per turn until cleansed. If you barrel into anything while poofed, it takes 
30 damage +10 poison damage per turn and must roll a shock save DC of 50 to not 
be paralyzed. You are easier to hit while in this state and take an additional 
%10 damage from any damage done to you.
