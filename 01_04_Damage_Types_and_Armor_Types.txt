Damage Types and Armor Types
============================== 

===== Damage Types =====

== Common Damage Types ==

Ballistic Damage:
	Ballistic damage results from the impact and/or penetration of solid 
projectiles, causing physical damage and secondary shock effects to living and 
mechanical systems.
    
	Ballistic damage is dealt first to armor, and then to health. It 
bypasses shields.

Plasma Damage:
	Plasma damage is dealt by the impact of a hot and highly charged plasma 
projectile and/or spray. It tends to cause large burns to targets' exterior surfaces 
and electrical shock throughout.

	Plasma damage is dealt first to shields, then to armor, and then to health, 
but shields and armor can only absorb up to half of each plasma attack's damage 
(rounded up). A character with armor but no shields (and no other defensive effects) 
would always take at least half of a plasma attack's damage to their health.

	Additionally, whenever a character takes Plasma damage to their health, 
they gain one instance of Plasma Burn (see Conditions). 

	Armor damaged by Plasma loses 1 APL. This effect cannot stack and wears off 
after the encounter.

Laser Damage:
	Laser damage is a burn or explosive energy release delivered by a high-
intensity stream of photons, or light. The burns are more localized than those of 
Plasma projectiles.
	
	Laser damage is dealt first to shields, and then to health. It 
bypasses armor.

== Additional Damage Types ==

Acid Damage:
	Some damage is dealt when a substance of a significantly different PH balance
comes in contact with your player and chemically reacts in an adverse manner.
Such cases are usually painful and smell bad. 

	While taking acid damage doesn't always mean that you have an ongoing 
effect, read the source of the damage carefully to see if in addition to the 
one-time damage effect, you also have an ongoing effect to deal with as well. 
Acid damage can affect armor adversely as well, but that is not implied simply 
by an attack being labeled with acid damage. Such effects will be listed 
separately in the attack, trap, etc.

	Acid damage is dealt first to armor, and then health. It bypasses shields.

Electric Damage:
	Some damage is dealt to characters with a high current and voltage. This
can lead to burns, organ failure, fried circuits and chaotic effects on the 
nervous or control systems of a given character. This damage does not have any
special effect on armor, but certain characters are more prone to electric 
damage than others, while some characters are more resistant to it.

	Electric damage is dealt first to shields, and then health. It bypasses 
armor.

Explosive Damage:
	Certain grenades and devices deal explosive damage, which is a shockwave 
transmitted through any liquid or gaseous medium. Though fragmentation grenades 
may seem like explosive weapons, they deal ballistic damage because their 
primary damage delivery method is shrapnel.

	Explosive damage is dealt directly to health, bypassing armor and shields.

Internal Damage:
    Internal damage can be taken from things like parasites, malicious
microbots, or simply pushing your character's physical body past its breaking
point. 

	Internal damage is dealt directly to health, bypassing armor and shields. 
Unless otherwise stated, it also bypasses all other defensive effects.

Thermal Damage:
	Some damage is dealt with conflagrations, general combustion or extreme 
cold. While this damage often leaves an ongoing burning effect, this damage 
type does not imply that simply by being Thermal Damage. Please read a given 
attack or event carefully to see if you are simply burned once, or have an 
ongoing effect as well. Some characters are more resistant to Thermal Damage 
than others. Similarly, some armor in the game helps mitigate Thermal Damage 
more effectively than others as well. 

	Thermal damage is dealt first to shields, then armor, and then health.

===== Protection Types =====

Armor:
	Ballistic Armors (or more simply, Armor) protect the wearer by absorbing 
and spreading out physical impacts. When armor is impacted by a projectile with 
mass, it takes damage before its wearer, as described in Combat Rules.

	Armor is fully effective against Ballistic, Acid, and Thermal damage. It 
is partially effective against Plasma damage.

	Purchaseable armors can be found in the /items/Armor section.

Shields:
	Shields are generated by armor hard point modules, and surround the user 
in a protective particle field that can absorb the energy of massless projectiles, 
taking their damage before the user as described in Combat Rules.

	Shields are fully effective against Laser, Electric, and Thermal damage. 
They are partially effecive against Plasma damage.

	Shield modules attach to armor hard points and can be found in 
/items/Hard_Point_Equipment.txt.

===== Fall Damage =====

    Beyond weapon damage, there are also environmental threats to consider. An 
important note is on fall damage. A player can fall up to their Dex/2 in 
meters before needing to roll an acrobatics check. If the surface they are 
landing on is somehow fouled, the GM may require the player to roll an 
acrobatics check when landing from any height at their discretion. On a failed 
roll, take damage equal to 2 times the height fallen. The player also incurs 
one injury, depending on the severity of the fall. Some examples are below:

* Sprained ankle(s)
* Broken ankle(s)
* Broken leg(s)
* Broken arm(s) in addition to leg(s)
* Broken everything
