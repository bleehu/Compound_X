SKILL DCs
==============================
This document describes the Difficulty Checks for various skills, as a way for players to get a baseline assessment 
of their character's ability.

"Skill DCs:"
To accommodate the new Stat bonus system, skill DCs will be altered. There will be no rolling to pass a skill check. 
If your skill + relevant Stat Bonus passes the DC, you are able to complete the task. In combat, you will have to roll
to see if you can do the task quickly, and the DCs will be higher due to the stressful situation.
