==============================
Combat
==============================


	Combat starts when either you or an enemy decides they would like to make an 
attack (or as the GM decrees). At that point, all involved characters roll 
Initiative to determine the order in which they take turns. Initiative is a d100 roll 
that is modified only by Soldier class passive abilities, and higher numbers go 
first. The section "Actions", below, has more detail on turns in combat.

===== Combat Stat Modifiers for Ranged and Melee Accuracy =====

	These bonuses use a table instead of the more general attribute modifier 
equation, as combat accuracy rolls are played out on a d10 scale. As described below, 
under normal conditions, ranged combat uses the Perception combat modifier, while 
melee combat uses Strength, Dexterity, and Fortitude.

== Combat Stat Modifier Table ==

+--------+-------------+
| Stat   | Stat Bonus  |
+--------+-------------+		
| 1      | -1.5	       |
+--------+-------------+
| 2      | -1	       |
+--------+-------------+
| 3-4    | -0.5	       |
+--------+-------------+	
| 5      |  0	       |	
+--------+-------------+	
| 6-7    |  0.5	       |	
+--------+-------------+	
| 8-9    |  1	       |	
+--------+-------------+	
| 10-11  |  1.5	       |	
+--------+-------------+	
| 12-13  |  2	       |	
+--------+-------------+	
| 14     |  2.5	       |		
+--------+-------------+
| 15     |  3	       |		
+--------+-------------+

	Drop any remaining decimal (0.5 or -0.5 becomes 0) -in other words- only use 
integers when you are writing down the final miss chances of your weapon(s). For 
example, let's say you have a basic SMG with miss chance brackets of 4, 5, and 6. 
Assuming you have 6 Perception,your PER bonus is 0.5 and thus, your gun's range 
miss chance brackets are:

	(4 - 0.5), (5 - 0.5), (6 - 0.5)  =  3.5, 4.5, 5.5

	If these are your final miss chances, you would have to drop the remainder 
and your slightly-above-average perception wouldn't make enough of a difference 
to affect your miss chances!

	But let's say you also have a Dot Sight that you can put on your SMG. The 
Dot Sight gives a bonus -0.5 range bracket miss chance (among other benefits). 
This means you now have the following range brackets:

	(4 - 0.5 - 0.5), (5 - 0.5 - 0.5), (6 - 0.5 - 0.5)  =  3, 4, 5

	Perfect! Now your Perception and Dot Sight bonuses, together, reduce your 
range bracket miss chances by 1 point. If you don't have any other bonuses (from 
other attachments, feats, or abilities) then you would write down 3, 4, 5 as 
your range bracket miss chances.

	If your gun has automatic and/or burst fire, you'd add its associated miss 
chances to your range bracket miss chances and separately write down those 
numbers (after all bonuses to range bracket miss chance and bonuses to automatic 
or burst fire). In other words, if you have a ranged weapon with semi-auto, 
burst, and automatic fire modes, then you should write down 3 sets of 3 miss
chances; one set for each of the 3 fire modes. For example, let's now assume 
your gun has a burst fire miss chance of 1 and an automatic fire miss
chance of 3, your ranged bracket miss chances should look something like this...

0-10m, 11-20m, 21-40m	range brackets
  3,     4,      5    	semi-auto miss chances
  4,     5,      6	burst fire miss chances
  6,     7,      8	automatic fire miss chances


===== Miss Chance Limits =====

	At any time when using a melee or ranged weapon, you have a minimum of -2 
weapon miss chance, and a minimum of +1 miss chance modifier from automatic or 
burst fire modes (if relevant). These minimums apply after all PER/DEX/STR/Attachment 
modifiers, at all ranges, and before cover and any other environmental effects. 
Using an ability could push you below the minimum miss chance.

    Outside a weapon's longest range, you cannot hit your target.
Also, weapons cannot shoot over 100m without magnifying sights, or over 150m 
without 2x+ magnification.

===== Melee Combat =====

	A character of standard size occupies 1m of space. This is not the physical 
space occupied, but rather both the area effectively controlled by the character and 
the minimum necessary to effectively fight.

	Two characters engaged in melee combat are considered to be in adjacent 1m 
spaces, not in the same 1m space. Fights don't generally start face-to-face unless 
you're at a bar.

	Once a character has attempted to attack another at melee range (1m), 
they are both considered to be in melee combat. They can make attacks against 
each other with unarmed strikes, melee weapons (improvised or not), or CQB guns 
as normal. Attacking a target more than 1m away, using a non-CQB weapon, or 
moving away from the melee (under the character's own power: explosion knockback 
does not count) will incur an Opportunity Attack as described below.
	
Opportunity Attack:
	A reactionary attack that is triggered when an opponent leaves melee combat, 
walks past (within melee range) an alert character, performing a skill check 
when engaged in melee combat that requires the use of the character's primary 
manipulator limbs (so a medicine check to stabilize an ally would incur an 
attack, but an acrobatics check to kick away a grenade would not) or by 
trying to shoot an opponent more than 1m away while engaged in melee combat.

	Opportunity attacks can be made with a drawn CQB weapon or a melee weapon. 
If the free attack is made with a CQB weapon and the weapon is not already 
aimed at the target, standard Hip Firing rules apply.

Making Melee Attacks:
	Melee attackers make accuracy rolls with a d10, increased by strength and 
dexterity combat modifiers and their weapon's accuracy modifier. To successfully 
hit, the result must be greater than (not equal to) the opponent's Guard roll. 
If you successfully hit your opponent, armor applies as normal except as 
detailed in the next two topics.

	Defending players roll Guard with a d10 as well, increased by fortitude 
and dexterity combat modifiers and their weapon's guard bonus. Guard bonuses are 
not usually listed in individual weapon entries (some exceptions exist), but 
instead are based on weapon type. See the table below for weapon type Guard 
modifiers. A character must be proficient with a weapon to benefit from its 
Guard modifier, otherwise it is treated as an improvised melee weapon of the 
appropriate size. 

	A Guard roll equal to or greater than an attacker's accuracy causes 
the attack to miss. One may think of melee attacks as opposed contests of skill, 
though no Skill check applies to these attacks and blocks.

Hacker terminal, and similar devices.

Hitting What You Intend:
	If you roll 3 or more above your target's Guard, you may ignore any 
armor worn by the target and damage health directly.
	
Blunt Force:
	Unless otherwise specified, melee weapons have an APL of 0, which 
for most weapons would mean they do no damage if they hit armor. Instead, 
melee attacks that hit armor still deal the STR mod portion of their damage 
directly to the target's health. For example, a One-handed combat sword that 
deals 20 + STR mod + DEX mod damage, wielded by a character with a STR mod 
of 12, that hits its target's armor would deal no damage to the armor and 
12 damage to the target's health. If the sword was a Hybrid weapon and the 
attack was a two-handed strike, the health damage would be 18.

Nonlethal Damage:
	By default, melee attacks do lethal damage, like the vast majority of 
guns. This just means that when an attack drops a target to 0 health, they 
enter the Bleeding Out state. However, when fighting unarmed or with a melee 
weapon that you are proficient with, you may declare a melee attack you have 
not yet rolled to be nonlethal. This imposes a -2 accuracy penalty, since you are 
imposing constraints upon yourself on where you can strike, but if a nonlethal 
attack would reduce a target to 0 health, the target instead drops to 1 health 
and becomes Unconscious (and does not gain the Bleeding Out condition). 

	A target reduced to exactly 1 health by a nonlethal attack does not 
fall Unconscious. 1 is not 0.

== Combat Maneuvers ==

	In addition to smashing an opponent directly, there are other offensive 
actions that characters in melee combat may take. Also, some exotic weapons may 
allow these maneuvers to be performed even outside melee: individual weapon 
rules take precedence.

	Maneuvers make use of opposed skill checks. Both the actor and defender 
will roll a check, which does not have to be the same skill, and whoever rolls 
a higher total wins. Defenders win ties. 

The Opposed Maneuver Check:
	Most maneuvers make use of the same mildly complex skill opposition, 
called the opposed maneuver check. It does not refer to a "maneuver" skill, 
but is short for the following instructions. The attacking or acting character 
rolls STR-Athletics, and the defender rolls his or her choice of STR-Athletics 
or DEX-Acrobatics. Initiating a grapple, shove, trip, etc. is mostly a matter 
of brute strength, but such attempts may be opposed strength for strength or 
dodged by superior agility.

Grappling:
	Grappling is a maneuver where a character physically grabs another, 
attempting to immobilize the target. To initiate a grapple, a character initiates 
an opposed maneuver check. If the target wins, the grapple fails and nothing happens. 
If the grappler wins, both characters gain the Grappled state, and the attacker 
starts with control. 

	Characters shooting at a target in the Grappled state may hit both or 
either. With wide-effect weapons like flamethrowers or buckshot, the attack may 
be made against either target but the damage is divided evenly among the grappled 
characters. Attacks with other weapons have a 50% + the shooter's LUC mod to hit 
the intended target, and otherwise hit the other.
	
	While in the Grappled state, most ranged attacks at range R2 or R3 (based 
on the weapon used) against either character have a 50% chance to hit the other, 
though shooters may add their LUCK mod to the 50 to hit their chosen target. Wider 
effect weapons like flamethrowers and buckshot always evenly divide their damage 
among the grappled characters.

	While in the grappled state, the characters are limited in the actions 
they can take, can only target each other, and may use only one Action per round. 
The character with control of the grapple may make Unarmed Strikes, use other 
combat maneuvers, attempt to Pin, or disengage. The character without control 
may make Unarmed Strikes, attempt to disengage, or attempt to gain control. 
Each effort takes one Action.

	While in the Pinned state, a character may only attempt to disengage, and 
success will return the character to the grappled state, without control, instead 
of releasing the character from the grapple. The character grappling with a Pinned 
target may attempt to restrain the target with a further opposed maneuver check and 
appropriate tool, such as zip cuffs. Success renders the target helpless (until 
they can break the bonds, which depends on the item used, see item descriptions). 
Pinned targets are also vulnerable to knockout and kill actions: both render the 
target unconscious and reduce him or her to 1 health, but a successful kill action 
also forces the target to make a death saving throw. Knockout and Kill require two 
consecutively won opposed maneuver checks, and targets additionally add their Shock 
modifier to their roll when defending against attempts to kill. If a character 
restrains, knocks out, or kills a grappled target, he or she is still grappled and 
must spend an Action to disengage.
	
	Grappling-specific actions are described below.
	
Pin: 	The attacker and defender make an opposed maneuver check. If the attacker 
	wins, the defender gains the Pinned state.
Disengage: Characters in control of a grapple may disengage without rolling. 
	Otherwise both characters choose one of STR-Athletics or DEX-Acrobatics 
	and roll an opposed check (choices may differ). If the disengager wins, 
	the grapple ends (and the active character has 3 Actions available this 
	round).
Gain Control: The involved characters make an opposed maneuver check as if the 
	acting character was initiating. If successful, that character gains 
	control of the grapple, affecting the actions available to both characters.

Shoving:
	This maneuver attempts to force the target to move in a particular direction. 
The attacker must declare the direction he or she is attempting to move the target, 
then they roll an opposed maneuver check. If the attacker wins, both characters move 
in the indicated direction a number of meters equal to half the attacker's Strength. 
Shoving a grappled target does not end the grapple. Shoved targets to not provoke 
opportunity attacks, but shoving attackers might.

Kicking:
	Or whatever appendage your species uses to launch things. Kicking is identical
to Shoving except that only the target is moved, and that the target moves 50% farther 
if kicked directly away from the attacker. If a grappled target is successfully kicked, 
the grapple ends. Kicked targets do not provoke opportunity attacks,

Trip:
	This maneuver attempts to force the target to the floor. If the attacker wins 
an opposed maneuver check, the target gains the prone state. Tripping a grappled 
target ends the grapple.

Disarm:
	This maneuver attempts to relieve the target of a carried item or weapon. 
The character initiating this maneuver declares a weapon or item the defending 
character is wielding. Both attacker and defender choose between STR-Athletics 
and DEX-Acrobatics (choices may differ) and make an opposed check. Defenders have 
Disadvantage on the check if they do not have proficiency with the targeted item 
(for this purpose, improvised melee weapons are treated as regular melee weapons 
of the appropriate size). If the attacker wins, the defender is forced to drop the 
targeted object.

===== MELEE WEAPONS & UNARMED FIGHTING =====

	These weapons/attacks use an 'Accuracy Modifier' instead of
a 'Miss Chance', which is added to your combat dex modifier and
and any relevant feat or skill bonuses to oppose your opponent's 
Guard Roll. Melee weapons do not pierce armor, unless otherwise 
stated.

	Melee weapons come in one of four size categories. The first 
three are Light, One-handed, and Two-handed. Characters start 
with proficiency with some number of these based on their class. The 
fifth category is Exotic. Acquiring proficiency with Exotic weapons does 
not grant access to all Exotic weapons, but rather to a particular type, 
such as whips. Exotic proficiencies may rarely be granted by Backgrounds, 
and are more commonly acquired by feats.

	When a Two-handed weapon uses a character's STR mod in its damage 
calculation and the character's STR mod is positive, that character instead 
uses 150% of their STR modifier to calculate damage. For example, if some 
two-handed weapon dealt damage equal to 40 + 2xSTR nod and the character 
wielding it had a STR mod of -4, each strike would deal 32 = 40 + (-4 * 2) 
damage. A character with the same weapon and a STR mod of 12 would deal 
76 = 40 + ((12 * 1.5) * 2) = 40 + (18 * 2) damage per strike.

	Some One-handed weapons have the Hybrid size property. Characters 
with proficiency with Two-handed melee weapons may make two-handed strikes 
with these weapons, which allows them to add their STR modifier as if 
the weapon was Two-handed (see the preceeding paragraph). Such a strike 
must be declared to be two-handed before rolling to hit, and the character 
doing so loses the benefits of any items that require his or her off hand to 
function.*

	Unarmed Strike is not a weapon and therefore does not have a 
size category. All characters are considered proficient with Unarmed 
Strike. Efficacy is an entirely separate issue.

*As an example, a character with a STR mod of 8 is attacking an enemy with a 
hammer of size One-handed - Hybrid that deals 40 + STR mod damage. Before 
rolling the attack, the player may declare that the character is making a 
two-handed strike, which will increase the damage from 40 + 8 = 48 to 
40 + (8 * 1.5) = 40 + 12 = 52. If that character was holding a weapon or 
defensive implement in his or her off-hand, that item cannot be used and 
it provides no bonuses for one round.

===== Thrown Weapons =====

	These weapons work similarly to guns in that attackers add their combat PER 
mod to their accuracy, however their range is determined by the attacker's DEX or 
STR. Like melee attacks, if you roll a critical hit or 3+ above your Miss Chance, 
you ignore the target's armor and deal full damage. Thrown weapons also benefit 
from Stealth Attacks (see basic rules).

	Thrown weapons benefit from half the base damage bonuses from Unarmed Combat 
feats.

	If you have Weapons - Thrown skill >=20 then all DEX or STR requirements 
for Thrown Weapons are reduced by 1.

	All misc thrown weapons have a Reflex Modifier: -10
	
	Thrown weapons use the same size categories as Melee weapons for 
determining proficiency, though a Two-handed throwing weapon would be 
rare indeed.

===== Grenades =====

	All grenades require an explosives skill of at least 6 to use.
You can 'cook' a grenade in your hand for 1 action to make it impossible for an
enemy to dodge.

	Gain +2 Accuracy if you are throwing under half of your grenade's max 
throwing distance. If you fail your throw within 1 miss chance of the minimum, 
roll d4 meters for how off-target the grenade throw is. If you fail your throw 
beyond 1 miss chance, roll a d10 instead.

	All grenades have a Reflex Modifier: -10

==============================
Actions
==============================

    During combat, your character has 4 Actions. Actions are used for fighting, 
movement, items, whimpering, etc. Here is a list of common tasks and their
relative cost:

Reloading a Pump-Action Shotgun: 4 Actions
Reloading a Bolt-Action Weapon: 3 Actions
Reloading a Magazine Fed Weapon: 2 Actions
Moving DEX # of Meters: 2 Actions
Hunkering Down: 1 Action
Firing a Semi-Auto Gun: 1 Action
Suppressing an Area/Target: 1 Action
Cast a Spell: 1 Action
Aiming Down Gun Sights: 1 Action
Turning on a Flashlight: 1 Action
Unholstering Pistol or Grabbing a Weapon/Item: 1 Action
Performing a Skill Check (other than Getting Bearings): 1 Action
Conversing With Partners: Free Action
Getting Your Bearings / Non Skill-Based Perception: Free Action

Free Actions:
	Free Actions refer to tasks that take miniscule amounts of time, even
in pitched combat, like looking around, speaking briefly, or reflexively 
shutting your eyes after being treated to a flash-bang. Aside from your 
GM's patience and willingness to believe your character can do everything you 
want in a negligible timescale, there is no limit to the number of Free Actions 
a character may take, and they may be used at any time.

===== Reactions & Held Actions =====

Reactions:
	Certain abilities or circumstances will allow you do something 
in response to a triggering event. Doing so requires using a special kind 
of Action called a Reaction. Reactions occur at the immediate moment 
that they are triggered, regardless of whose turn it is. Common uses of 
Reactions include Opportunity Attacks (described in "Melee Combat", above) 
and Held Actions, below. After the Reaction occurs, play continues as normal. 
If it was an opponent's turn, they continue their turn. 

	A character may use up to three Reaction per round, regardless of how 
many viable trigger circumstances occur.

Held Actions:
	A type of Reaction. A player may choose to forgo using up to 2 actions at 
the end of their turn. The player must declare to their DM what those actions 
are to be triggered by, and then play continues as normal. If the trigger occurs 
before the player's next turn, the player gets to immediately use their 1 or 2 
actions. If the trigger does not occur before the player's turn, they lose their
held action(s) and start their turn as normal. 

	For example, let's say my Character and his/her friends are walking along a 
ledge. I know that one of the Characters in the party is clumsy so I have my 
Character move along the ledge, and I ask the DM if I can save my last action to 
try and catch the clumsy Character, should they trip. The DM approves my plan 
and play continues. On the clumsy Character's turn, they start to scoot across
the ledge and trip! As soon as they trip, my held action triggers and my 
Character saves them from falling off the ledge and their turn continues. If 
they had not tripped, my held action would've been lost at the start of my 
following turn.

===== Movement and Sprinting =====

	You can run 'Movement Speed' minus 'Movement Speed Penalty' number of meters 
for every 2 actions spent (Movement Speed Penalties should be rounded up before 
the subtraction). A character with 1 Movement Speed and 0 move speed penalties 
can move 1m per 2 actions, or 2m per 4 actions (a full turn). You can sprint 
instead of running, for a +1 movement bonus per action. However, firing your 
weapon after doing so will cause you to incur a +1 miss chance penalty. The 
penalty occurs during the actions you sprint, as well as 2 actions afterwards. 
You can sprint for a number of consecutive Actions equal to your Fortitude. You 
can jump horizontally Dex/2 meters, and add 1m if you have a 3m running start.
You can jump vertically Str/3 meters.

===== Other Combat Details =====

Critical Hits:
	Critical Hits are accuracy rolls that land inside your Critical Hit range 
(aka. critical chance). The base critical hit range is 1, meaning an Accuracy roll of 
10 is a critical hit. Luck modifies your critical hit range: (Luck Modifier/10), round 
down, is added to your critical hit range. Therefore if you have a Luck stat 
of 8, corresponding to a Luck Modifier of 12, then you would have +1 to your 
critical hit range and would critically hit on rolls of 9-10. Negative Luck modifiers 
do not reduce Critical Hit range.

	When your Accuracy roll lands in the upper half of your Critical Hit range,
it is referred to as an Extra-Critical Hit. When the range is odd, it may be necessary 
to roll a confirmation D10 to determine which kind of crit you score. Example: If you 
have a Critical range of 1 and roll a 10, you would roll another D10 and score a 
Critical hit on 1-5 or an Extra-Critical on 6-10.

	Regular Critical Hits deal +20 damage, while Extra-Criticals deal +30 damage. 
Some abilities or feats have additional effects that trigger when you score Criticals 
or Extra-Criticals.

	You cannot score Critical Hits while firing a gun in burst or automatic mode.

Armor and Getting Hit:
	When a player is defending against a successful enemy hit, they roll 
Percentiles under their armor in order to see if their armor blocked the bullet, 
and from there, how much damage they receive. If the defending player has no 
armor, they armor roll for a target 50 Percentile. If the armor roll is 50% or 
above, they receive half-damage. Below 50%, full damage.

	Armor consists of 3 concepts: Armor Points (APs), Armor Piercing level (APL),
and % Coverage. Starting from the end, Coverage is simply the percentile that 
you have to roll under to see if armor was hit. If the attack misses armor, or 
rolls over 50%, it does half damage because the bullet is hitting a less vital 
part of the body. If the attack hits armor: Armor Piercing level (APL) comes 
into play. 

	APL is a unitless number that represents how well a weapon can pierce armor or
how well armor can block bullets. If the attackers weapon's APL is less than the
defenders armor's APL, all damage is blocked. If the weapon's APL is greater than
or equal to the armor's APL, then Armor Points (APs) come into play. 

	APs are, effectively, your armor's ability to slow down projectiles as they
pass through it. Whenever armor is successfully pierced, all damage is first inflicted
on APs. Once the APs are used up, all remaining damage goes to health. APs refresh at the
start of the armor wearer's turn.

Shields:
	If you are looking to defend against Lasers or Plasma, you're in the right 
place. Every laser-toting plasma-fuming space hooligan will be looking to turn 
you into space-bacon ('spacon' for short) on your adventure; shields will slow 
that process down. If you are hit with a laser, shields absorb 100% of the 
damage, reducing the shield's strength by the damage taken. If you are hit with 
a plasma weapon, the shield absorbs 50% of the damage, and the rest passes 
through to the next line of defense (either armor [if present] or the 
character's body). If the Shield's Strength is reduced to 0, all remaining 
damage passes through unabated.

	As long as the Shield's Strength isn't reduced to 0, the shield will 
recharge 'Recharge Rate / Turn' number of points at the start of the wearer's 
turn. If the Shield's Strength is reduced to 0, you must wait a "Shield Restart 
Time" number of turns before the shield will restart at "Recharge Rate" 
strength. If you get hit with a weapon/by melee during that time, you must start 
your "Shield Restart Time" over again. 

	If you don't want to wait that long, at the start of your turn you can pay 
the "Fast Recharge Nanites" cost to restart your shields. Or if your Shield's 
Strength is just damaged, at the start of your turn you can pay the "Fast 
Recharge Nanites" cost to boost the Shield's Strength by an extra "Recharge Rate 
/ Turn" (in other words, 2x "Recharge Rate / Turn" instead of the normal 1x).

Shock:
	When players take more than 70 damage, they must roll a Shock save at a DC 
of the damage taken. On fail they pass out. on success they stay conscious. When 
players fail, they may roll each turn at a DC of 70 to wake up. They continue to 
roll either for (15 - FORT) turns, or until they pass.

Stealth Attacks:

	If you are hidden (undetected by an opponent) when you initiate an attack 
action, you incur bonuses depending on the circumstances of the attack.

	Ranged weapon stealth-attacks (including explosive grenades but not any 
other thrown weapons) have -1 miss chance to hit if 'adequate' aiming time is 
given (DM's discretion: how rushed you are, or how skilled you are at stealth, 
etc). Ranged weapon stealth-attacks gain +20 bonus damage.

	If you stealth-attack a target in melee, your target has a guard DC of 0. As
normal (see section, "melee combat"), if you roll 3+ above your miss chance (3+ above
the opponent's guard DC), you ignore the opponent's armor and deal full damage.
This signifies that the target gets hit in whatever you deem to be the most vulnerable;
i.e., the head, neck, or the chest (over the heart, etc). 

*Base Damage is typically the damage of the weapon without any other character 
bonuses, but Base Damage can be increased by certain classes and abilities.

**Increases to 200 max damage at level 10.

Flanking:
	If you are behind a target, aka flanking, your melee attacks gain +2 bonus 
accuracy against their Guard DC. (Ranged attacks don't gain a specific bonus 
from flanking.)

===== Ranged Combat =====

	If a player or opponent is standing outside of cover and they are shot at, 
after the first firing action (assuming they didn't die or go unconscious), 
they immediately, 'Hit the Dirt'. When you Hit the Dirt, you dive to the ground,
going prone, within a 2m range of where you stood (DEX movement rules apply 
as normal). Hitting the dirt consumes the 1st action of their next turn.

	To fire, you must be within the longest range limit of your gun*, i.e. be at 
a distance smaller than your gun's largest Range Bracket**, and you must not be 
out of ammo. You can aim and fire or, more simply, just fire at a target. If you 
shoot without aiming, you are "Hip Firing" and incur additional aiming penalties 
(see Hip Firing, below). 

*Actually you can fire at any range you like, but you won't necessarily hit anything.
Except for air, you will always hit air (unless you're in space).

**You cannot shoot weapons at a distance of over 100m without magnifying sights 
or over 150m without 2x+ magnification.

	Aiming at an enemy requires one action but significantly increases the 
effectiveness of your fire. Taking aim requires that you select a particular target 
that you can either perceive directly or have a high confidence in its current 
position. You must be able to see or otherwise percieve the target clearly, but they 
do not have to be within your weapon's range. Against this target only, ranged attacks 
follow the normal, non-Hip Fire rules. Characters may cease aiming as a free action, 
for example to aim at a different target. Additionally, aim is ceased automatically 
in any of the following circumstances: 

* The target dies***.
* The target moves a large distance unexpectedly****.
* The aiming character hunkers.
* The aiming character is thrown (for example, by a frag grenade).
* The aiming character suffers impairment to his or her primary sense (such as from a flashbang).

***As an optional rule, if a character's aim target dies, and the death was not 
unexpected, then the character may shift aim to another target within 5m of the first 
as a Free Action. DM discretion is advised for close combat situations.

****Possibly by coming out of cover 5+ meters from the last known location.

	Aiming is relatively simple and does not need to be treated with excessive
formality. If a character could reasonably take or keep aim at something, then he or 
she can.

== Fire Rates ==

	Most weapons are Semi-Auto, meaning that each time you pull the trigger, the 
gun fires once and chambers a new round automatically. It takes 1 Action to fire 
a semi-auto weapon in this way. Some guns, such as Shotguns and Bolt-Action 
sniper rifles require 2 Actions to fire the gun, where the first Action is a 
trigger pull, and the second Action is the rechambering of the weapon. Some weapons
are capable of higher rates of fire, like Assault Rifles. These weapons often have
more than one fire mode such as Fully-Automatic (Auto) and Burst. Auto or Burst 
mode allows the user to fire 6 or 3 shots for 1 Action, respectively (unless
otherwise noted). 

== Rolling a Ranged Attack ==

	To hit a target, Players must roll a d10 that is over their weapon's miss 
stat. When an enemy is in cover, their cover score is added to your weapon's 
miss chance. Lets say your normal ranged miss chance is 2, and the enemy is in 
full cover, your miss chance is increased by 4, for a final DC of 6. So a roll 
of 7-10 would be successful.

== Gun Jams ==
	If at any time that you are firing a gun and you roll a weapon accuracy of 1,
roll a second d10. If that second d10 roll is a 1 or 2, the weapon Jams, 
necessitating a Weapon - [X] Skill check, DC 60.

== Hip Firing ==

	Add 3 to a weapon's miss chance. You cannot use optical attachments in hip 
firing unless otherwise noted. It is much smarter to takes one action to Aim, 
and spend the rest of your shots firing. It's also a great idea to take an 
action at the end of your turn to "hunker," and gain a +2 cover advantage.

	If your weapon has a minimum distance (usually because of a high-powered
scope), and you fire inside that distance, you are forced to hip fire.

== Blind Firing ==

	Add 6 to a ranged weapon's miss chances. Blind firing allows you to shoot 
around cover without looking or putting yourself at risk. You can blind fire 
while hunkered. Your blind fire miss chance is affected by your base weapon miss 
chance(s), not affected by attachments unless otherwise noted, reduced by PER 
stat combat bonus (as usual), and reduced by LUCK stat combat bonus. It's 
recommended to calculate this separate miss chance and write it down before 
combat.

== Firing into Melee Combat ==

	When firing at a character engaged in Melee Combat, you aren't guaranteed 
to hit the target you intended. Before rolling accuracy, roll a DC 50 Luck check. 
You may add 10 to your roll if you are aimed at your target. On success, you hit 
your intended target. On failure, you hit a randomly chosen character engaged in 
Melee Combat with your intended target. In either case your attack them proceeds 
as normal. This Luck check cannot Critically succeed or fail.

== Using Cover/Stances ==

	Chances are, if an enemy can see you in Compound X, they can hit you. Using 
cover will make you harder to be hit. You will encounter many types of cover 
while adventuring throughout the galaxy. Many small objects provide only partial 
cover, either by partially obscuring your silhouette, or by providing slight 
protection from projectiles. Full cover will do both to a better degree. 
"Partial Cover" typically covers 30-50% of your body, whereas "Full Cover" will 
cover closer to 60-80%. Crouching or going prone will also take better advantage 
of your surroundings and make you a smaller target. Debuffs to opponents' Miss 
Chances are as follows:

No Cover: +0
Partial Cover: +2 
Full Cover: +4
Crouching: +1 (on top of whatever cover you're behind, may completely obscure vision)
Prone: +2* 
Hunkering: +2 (on top of whatever cover you're behind.)

*(on top of whatever -partial- cover you're behind, otherwise, may completely 
obscure vision. Does not provide a bonus against an opponent that is within 5m 
of you if you aren't in cover from their perspective.)

	Crouching is a free action, and standing up costs 1 Action. While you are
crouched, you have -1 movement speed per action (minimum 1) and you cannot
sprint or use other movement abilities.

	Going prone costs 1 Action, and standing up costs 1 Action. Lying flat down on
your chest makes you a smaller target and helps you aim better, but also makes you
easier to hit in melee. -1 gun miss chance while prone and -2 melee Guard DC. Being
prone severely limits your movement: 1/2 movement speed while prone, round-up; maximum
2 movement per action.

	Hunkering costs 1 action, and you cannot fire your weapons except by blind-fire 
(see Blind Firing, above). Imagine curling up in a ball, to pose the absolute smallest
target possible. Its a free action to un-hunker.

===== Reloading =====

	When a gun runs out of ammunition, the user must pause to reload. "But how 
long do I gotta be outta the battle?" Great question!

	Each gun has a "Reload DC," rated based on the complexity and brevity of the 
weapon's reload. For example, an assault rifle, which has a very obvious 
magazine release button and protruding magazine, has an average DC of 30%. More 
complex weapons, such as high-precision sniper systems or exotic sub-machine 
guns might have a higher DC, maybe 40%. If the Player passes the reload, then 
the reload time is standard. For Box-Magazine fed Semi- and Fully-Automatic 
weapons, this is 2 Actions. Other, more complex weapons will specify their 
reload time. On a critical Weapons - [X] check to reload the weapon,
the reload time is halved (for Bolt-Actions it is reduced to 1 Action). On a 
failure, the reload time takes twice as long.

===== Suppression ===== 

	Every player with a ranged weapon gets the option to Suppress as the last 
action of their turn. Suppression, also known as, "laying down fire", 
"covering fire", or "suppressive fire" is the art of shooting a hail of 
bullets (as accurately as possible) to try and prevent the enemy from 
effectively fighting back while your team maneuvers. Suppression comes in
three flavors: light, medium, and heavy; these indicate how wide of an area
is suppressed as well as how effective that suppression is (defined below).
The type of suppression available to you is dependent on your weapon.

	When you Suppress, you aim at the target as part of the action and fire a
hail of bullets (within your weapon range). Suppression doesn't require any
rolls to initiate, the suppressor simply fires, creating a light/medium/heavy
suppression AOE (Area-of-Effect, typically a 1-3m circle). Even though Suppression
is an AOE effect, if you cross in-front of someone (someone who is suppressing 
a different person) you will likely trigger automatic attack rolls, DM's discretion.

	If a suppressed target moves out into the open (see below), they 
trigger automatic attack rolls (or automatic hits) by the suppressor, once 
per target per suppressor's turn. If the suppressed target shoots, they 
fire with +1 miss chance, not-stackable. Suppression status can't be purged 
unless you move outside the AOE. The only other way to stop being suppressed 
is to stop the suppressor from using a suppression action on you at the end 
of their turn.

Moving out into the open: 
	In the context of suppression and movement, "moving out into the open" 
includes moving into a new location while you can be hit by shots from the 
suppressor (this excludes moving into complete concealment, such as going prone 
behind a high concrete wall). For example, the following situations would 
trigger a free hit by the suppressor and give you the 'suppressed' status while 
remaining in the area (let's assume you are upright (not crouched or prone)):
moving from partial cover to an adjacent partial cover, moving from complete 
concealment behind a barricade to partial cover, and moving when you are caught 
out in the open.

	If the suppressor cannot physically hit you (such as being completely behind 
an impenetrable barrier) you are not suppressed. The suppressor doesn't need to 
see you to hit you, as in the case of suppressing a cloaked target. 

== Light Suppression ==

	As the last action of your turn, aim at a target and fire 3 rounds (or the 
rest of your magazine, at least 1 round has to be fired) to suppress 1m radius 
AOE around the target. The target takes a +1 miss chance malus until the start 
of your next turn, and if the target moves out into the open**, then roll an 
immediate reaction to hit the target with a (non-automatic fire) accuracy roll. 
Immediate reactions are stackable on a per-weapon basis.

== Medium/Moderate Suppression ==

	Identical to light suppression with the following exceptions, you must fire 
6 rounds from the current magazine to achieve 'moderate', and you don't have to 
roll to hit -- you automatically hit and roll armor.

== Heavy Suppression ==

	Identical to light suppression with the following exceptions: you must fire 
10 rounds from the current magazine to achieve 'heavy', you don't have to roll 
to hit -- you automatically hit x2 and roll for armor. You suppress all targets 
within a 2m radius AOE around the primary target.

**"Moving out into the open" includes moving into a new location while you can
be hit by shots from the suppressor (this excludes moving into complete concealment,
such as going prone behind a high concrete wall). For example, the following situations
would trigger a free hit by the suppressor and give you the 'suppressed' status
while remaining in the area (let's assume you are upright (not crouched or prone)):
moving from partial cover to an adjacent partial cover, moving from complete concealment
behind a barricade to partial cover, and moving when you are caught out in the open.

	If the suppressor cannot physically hit you (such as being completely behind an 
impenetrable barrier) you are not suppressed. The suppressor doesn't need to see 
you, to hit you.

==============================
Armor
==============================

	Please note that armor can have different types. We'll cover this later in
more depth in the 01_04_Damage_Types_and_Armor_Types.txt document.

===== ARMOR SYSTEMS =====
	Armor Systems are composed of an Armor Rig and a protective Armor Material. 
Having lots of armor may slow you down, but armor will prevent you from 
being easy prey. Armor Rigs can be broken down into 4 pieces: helmets,
chest rigs, arm rigs, and leg rigs. 

	Helmets mostly help for RP effects or holding night vision goggles.
The other 3 riggings provide ammunition space and (most rigs) provide
space for installing an Armor Material. Armor Materials must be purchased 
separately than Armor Rigs. Also, Armor systems do not include any protection
without an Armor Material. If you purchase more than one Material* to cover 
your whole body (installing in the Arm, Leg, and Chest Rigs, for example) it 
improves the Armor Coverage (% of Armor protection), but not the quantity of 
the Armor Strength (AS) or the Armor Piercing Level (APL). 

	For example: if you purchase a Chest Rig from the Medium Armor Systems
category and a Standard L1 Material, you'll have 40% coverage, 40 AS, and an 
APL of 1. Now, in addition, if you purchase the Leg Rig from the Medium Armor 
Systems and a Standard L1 Material, you'd have 55% coverage, 40 AS, and an
APL of 1.

*Note: you cannot mix-and-match Materials or Rig categories. Only one
kind of Material can be used for the one category of Rigging you are wearing.

===== WHERE IS MY AMMO STORAGE? =====

	If you are wearing any Armor Rigging, you have a certain amount of 
"Mag Space". When you are loading up your guns before a mission, you can decide 
how to arrange your Mag Space to suit your needs. "Mag Space" translates 1 to 1
into Primary Magazines, and 2 to 3 (or 1 to 1) into Secondary Magazines.

	For example, if I have a Chest Rig from the Recon Armor Systems category, I 
would have 5 Mag Space. I can turn that Mag Space into 3 Primary Magazine and 3
Secondary Magazine spaces, 5 Primary Magazine spaces, or any feasible combination. 

===== WHAT IS AN 'ADVANCED RIG'? =====

	Advanced (adv.) Rigs typically provide less Armor Coverage and Mag Space 
than their regular counterparts, but they allow you to attach Shield Generators,
Hard Point Equipment, and/or Cloaking Equipment. Advanced Rigs allow you to do
this by providing 'Hard Points'. Hard Points are special joints and fittings that
make it easy to attach equipment. When you purchase equipment, it will list how
many Hard Points it consumes. You can't attach more equipment than you have available
Hard Points.

	Hard Point Equipment/Shields/Cloaking often come in two sizes, "Primary Modules" and 
"Secondary Modules". After you purchase and install a Primary Module, you can also purchase
and install a Secondary Module(s) that augment the benefits of the Primary Module. The 
benefits are listed in the description of a given module. They do not mix and match;
Secondary Modules only work for the Primary Module they are designed for.
	Some modules have a "____ Skill Requirement". In order to operate the module, you
must have the required quantity of the given skill.

===== ARMOR RIGS =====

	Armor rigs cannot be worn in combination with other Rigs from different types, tactical 
vests, or EVA suits (for example: Recon Rigs can't be worn with Light Rigs). Some of the 
lighter Armor Rigs cannot hold Armor Materials, designated by "(*No Armor*)". Those rigs 
only provide more Mag Space or more Hard Points; they don't provide additional Armor Coverage.

===== EVA SUITS AND FLIGHT HELMETS =====

	Helmets may be worn with or added to Armor or Environment (EVA) suits.
EVA suits are air- and water-tight when combined with an EVA or flight helmet.
EVA suits are bulky and cannot be used with Armor Rigs, also, DEX skill checks
have a -10% penalty and movement is reduced in RP. If the suit is hit more 
times than its "Suit Integrity" rating, it will no longer be able to maintain
air pressure (player health has to be damaged in order for "Suit Integrity" to
count a hit). Suits traditionally come in white, yellow or red.

===== SHIELD GENERATORS =====

	Shields cover the wearer with a transparent field which blocks 
100% of incoming Laser damage, and 50% of Plasma weapon damage, 
as long as the Shield isn't drained of its "Shield Strength".
Traditionally, a Shield unit consists of a generator pack which 
is generally the size of a small backpack, and some field
stabilizers that extend the field over the body. Once the
Shield's capacitor units are exhausted, the Shield breaks and
needs a while to recharge. If the user maintains their Shield 
without letting it break, they can avoid the costly recharge time.
For more information, please see section "Shields" in the 
Basic Rules document.

==============================
Death, Dying, and Downed
==============================

	Oh no! You have less than 1 health point left! What now!?! The good news is 
you are not* dead yet. But you are doing what's known as "bleeding out". The 
first time your character falls below 1 hit point, you get 3 saving throws 
called Death Saving Throws (or 'DSTs' for short). You roll one saving throw per 
turn that you are downed and these DSTs are not modified by any attribute. If you 
succeed a DST, (see 'Downed', below) you continue bleeding out; however, you get 
to roll again next turn. If you fail 3 DSTs, you die. Once you fail a DST, the 
next time you fall below 1 health point you only get 2 DSTs (2 failed throws and 
you die). If you failed a DST during the first two times you were downed and 
you are downed a third time, you only get 1 DST. You regain a DST by going a 
whole encounter without failing a DST. You can have a maximum of 3 saving throws 
at any one time.

Downed:
	The state of having less than one Health Point is called being "downed." It 
is also sometimes called "bleeding out." They are equivalent. While a character 
is downed, they cannot move, cannot stand under their own power, and fall prone 
if not supported by other means. They cannot speak, but can mumble 
incomprehensibly.

	Every turn that a character takes while they are downed, they must make a 
Death Saving Throw of DC 50. Success and failure of these throws is detailed 
above. Even if you had 5 health and took 80 damage, when you go down you go to 0
health. Any additional attacks you sustain will push you into negative health. 

Stabilize:
	As an action, a character may choose an adjacent, Downed character and 
attempt to Stabilize them. That character makes DC 80 Dex-based skill check: 
Medicine for primarily organic targets, or Repair for primarily mechanical targets.
If successful, the target is revived and now has 1 HP, is no longer Downed, and 
may take Actions as normal within the initiative order. A character may be revived 
in a single encounter a number of times equal to half their Fort, minimum two. Past 
this limit, stabilized characters are unconscious in addition to the other effects 
of Stabilization. Note that most persistent damage effects, like bleeds or burns, 
fall off of characters when they are Downed.

	If a character fails a stabilization check, nothing happens. It's just 
taking longer to stem the bleeding. On critical success (base Critical range 10), 
your excellent care allows you to choose whether the target counts this revival 
against their revivals per encounter limit. On critical failure (01-05 before 
modifiers), the bleeding (or equivalent) gets worse: the target must immediately 
roll an additional Death Save. If the total check is then still high enough to 
succeed and the target is still alive, they are then Stabilized as normal.

	Up to one character may assist with a stabilization check. Either involved 
character may expend one Medkit (for primarily organic targets) or one Repair Kit 
(for primarily mechanical targets) to grant +20 to the Medicine check. Feel free 
to scavenge one from the target, they probably won't make a fuss. One kit provides 
a bonus to all Stabilization attempts made on the same target in one round.

	Don't forget that a recently stabilized character may need to take actions to
retrieve a dropped weapon or stand back up if they have fallen.

*Some hazards can reduce you to zero health points and kill you 
instantly. Some examples are falling several stories, lava baptisms,
or having a space station dropped on you. Do not do these things. They are
also known to the state of California to cause cancer.
