==============================
Combat
==============================

    Combat starts when either you or an enemy decides they would like to make an 
attack. Each "Player turn" lasts 4-6 seconds, and consists of 4 "Actions" 
(described below).

===== Miss Chance Limits =====

    At any time when using a melee or ranged weapon, you have a minimum of -2 
weapon miss chance, and a minimum of 1 Auto or Burst miss chance (if relevant). 
These minimums apply after all PER/DEX/STR/Attachment modifiers, at all ranges, 
and before cover and any other environmental effects. Using an ability could 
push you below the minimum miss chance.

===== Melee Combat =====

    A character occupies 1m of space. however, as Compound X is not played out 
on a squares-board, usually it doesn't matter if two players are within the same 
1m space.

    Two Players locked in melee combat are considered to be in adjacent 1m spaces, 
not in the same 1m space. Have you ever seen a fight? you don't start face-to-face 
unless you're at a bar.

    Generally speaking, once a character has initiated melee combat with another 
opponent, they are both considered to be in "melee combat," and occupy spaces 
within reach of one of the combatant's melee weapons. At this point (unless one 
character has a CQB weapon) both characters are assumed to be using their fists 
or other melee weapons. If a character wishes to leave melee combat, they incur 
an "Opportunity Attack."  
    
Opportunity Attack:
    A free attack* that is triggered when an opponent leaves melee combat or 
walks adjacent (within melee range) to a character that is aware of their 
opponent. Characters also incur Opportunity Attacks by performing a non-combat 
skill check when locked in melee combat (such as trying to repair their own 
armor) or by trying to shoot a different opponent with a non-CQB weapon.

*The free attack can be made with a CQB weapon or a melee weapon (depending on 
if the weapon is already equipped in the character's hands). If the free attack 
is made with a CQB weapon, and the weapon is not already aimed at the target, 
standard Hip Firing rules apply.

Making Melee Attacks:
    Melee combat is relatively simple. To hit an enemy player: add your 
dexterity combat modifier to a d10 roll plus your combat modifier from your 
weapon/attack*. The result must be greater than the opponent's Guard DC: 

    (DEX * 4)/10  

    Drop any decimal remainder. If you successfully hit your opponent, you roll 
armor as normal (for more details, see below sections "Armor and Getting Hit" 
and "Damage Types and Armor Types"). Your damage dealt is often based on a 
combination of your DEX and STR.

    NOTE: if you are fighting unarmed, you can (normally) deal full non-lethal 
damage or half lethal damage (your choice). Non-lethal damage should be recorded 
as a separate (duplicate) health bar. When their non-lethal health bar reaches 0, 
the target becomes unconscious/incapacitated.

*Modifiers from specific weapons or unarmed[x] attacks are listed in the weapons 
document.

Hitting What You Intend:
    If you roll 3+ above your miss chance (3+ above the opponent's guard DC), 
you ignore the opponent's armor and deal full damage. 

Grappling:
    A character may grapple another character when they are both in melee 
distance. Doing so provides the grappled player an Opportunity Attack on the 
grappling player. During grappling, both sides roll opposing grapple checks to 
see who maintains control. Once you have control you may make a grapple check 
to subdue your opponent (by choke-out, pin, or a joint lock). You may also strike
an opponent during grappling, but if the strike fails your opponent may attempt 
to gain control of the grapple.

Kicking/Shoving:
    Instead of dealing full damage, a character can try to kick/shove a human sized
opponent to force movement by rolling for a normal unarmed/armed melee attack 
with an additional -2 miss penalty against the opponent's Guard DC. If the attack 
succeeds, it yields 1/2 the damage it normally would and pushes the target up to
1m for every 5 strength you have.

===== Actions =====

    During combat, your character has 4 Actions. Actions are used for fighting, 
movement, items, whimpering, etc. Here is a list of common tasks and their
relative cost:

Reloading a Pump-Action Shotgun: 4 Actions
Reloading a Bolt-Action Weapon: 3 Actions
Reloading a Magazine Fed Weapon: 2 Actions
Moving DEX # of Meters: 2 Actions
Hunkering Down: 1 Action
Firing a Semi-Auto Gun: 1 Action
Suppressing an Area/Target: 1 Action
Cast a Spell: 1 Action
Aiming Down Gun Sights: 1 Action
Turning on a Flashlight: 1 Action
Unholstering Pistol or Grabbing a Weapon/Item: 1 Action
Performing a Skill Check (other than Getting Bearings): 1 Action
Conversing With Partners: Free Action
Getting Your Bearings / Non Skill-Based Perception: Free Action

===== Reactions & Held Actions =====

    Certain abilities or circumstances will allow you to take a special action 
in response to a triggering event. A reaction occurs at the immediate moment 
that it is triggered, whether it is your turn or not. The most common reaction 
you will encounter will be from Suppression (described in "Ranged Combat", 
below) or Opportunity Attacks (described in "Melee Combat", above). After the 
reaction occurs, play continues as normal (if it is an opponents turn, they 
continue their turn). 

Held Actions:
    A type of reaction. A player may choose to forgo using up to 2 actions at 
the end of their turn. The player must declare to their DM what those actions 
are to be triggered by then play continues as normal. If the trigger occurs 
before the player's next turn, the player gets to immediately use their 1 or 2 
actions. If the trigger does not occur before the player's turn, they lose their
held action(s) and start their turn as normal. 

    For example, let's say my Character and his/her friends are walking along a 
ledge. I know that one of the Characters in the party is clumsy so I have my 
Character move along the ledge, and I ask the DM if I can save my last action to 
try and catch the clumsy Character, should they trip. The DM approves my plan 
and play continues. On the clumsy Character's turn, they start to scoot across
the ledge and trip! As soon as they trip, my held action triggers and my 
Character saves them from falling off the ledge and their turn continues. If 
they had not tripped, my held action would've been lost at the start of my 
following turn.

===== Movement and Sprinting =====

    You can run 'Movement Speed' minus 'Movement Speed Penalty' number of meters 
for every 2 actions spent (Movement Speed Penalties should be rounded up before 
the subtraction). A character with 1 Movement Speed and 0 move speed penalties 
can move 1m per 2 actions, or 2m per 4 actions (a full turn). You can sprint 
instead of running, for a +1 movement bonus per action. However, firing your 
weapon after doing so will cause you to incur a +1 miss chance penalty. The 
penalty occurs during the actions you sprint, as well as 2 actions afterwards. 
You can sprint for a number of consecutive Actions equal to your Fortitude. You 
can jump horizontally Dex/2 meters, and add 1m if you have a 3m running start.
You can jump vertically Str/3 meters.


===== Other Combat Details =====

Critical Hits:
    Critical hits are accuracy rolls that land inside your critical hit range 
(aka. crit chance). If you roll a critical hit, your weapon does +20 damage for 
that attack (and/or other effects, depending on your abilities). By default, 
everyone starts with a critical hit range of "1", meaning, an attack roll of a 
10 would be considered a critical hit. But your critical range may not be "1" 
because your Luck modifies your critical hit range: (Luck Modifier/10), round 
down, is added to your critical hit range. Therefore if you have a Luck stat 
of 8, corresponding to a Luck Modifier of 12, then you would have +1 to your 
critical hit range and would critically hit on rolls of 9-10.

    Weapons with a high fire rate cannot critically hit (weapons that shoot more 
than 1 bullet per Action by default).

Armor and Getting Hit:
    When a player is defending against a successful enemy hit, they roll 
Percentiles under their armor in order to see if their armor blocked the bullet, 
and from there, how much damage they receive. If the defending player has no 
armor, they armor roll for a target 50 Percentile. If the armor roll is 50% or 
above, they receive half-damage. Below 50%, full damage.

    Armor consists of 3 concepts: Armor Points (APs), Armor Piercing level (APL),
and % Coverage. Starting from the end, Coverage is simply the percentile that 
you have to roll under to see if armor was hit. If the attack misses armor, or 
rolls over 50%, it does half damage because the bullet is hitting a less vital 
part of the body. If the attack hits armor: Armor Piercing level (APL) comes 
into play. 

    APL is a unitless number that represents how well a weapon can pierce armor or
how well armor can block bullets. If the attackers weapon's APL is less than the
defenders armor's APL, all damage is blocked. If the weapon's APL is greater than
or equal to the armor's APL, then Armor Points (APs) come into play. 

    APs are, effectively, your armor's ability to slow down projectiles as they
pass through it. Whenever armor is successfully pierced, all damage is first inflicted
on APs. Once the APs are used up, all remaining damage goes to health. APs refresh at the
start of the armor wearer's turn.

Shields:
    If you are looking to defend against Lasers or Plasma, you're in the right 
place. Every laser-toting plasma-fuming space hooligan will be looking to turn 
you into space-bacon ('spacon' for short) on your adventure; shields will slow 
that process down. If you are hit with a laser, shields absorb 100% of the 
damage, reducing the shield's strength by the damage taken. If you are hit with 
a plasma weapon, the shield absorbs 50% of the damage, and the rest passes 
through to the next line of defense (either armor [if present] or the 
character's body). If the Shield's Strength is reduced to 0, all remaining 
damage passes through unabated.

    As long as the Shield's Strength isn't reduced to 0, the shield will 
recharge 'Recharge Rate / Turn' number of points at the start of the wearer's 
turn. If the Shield's Strength is reduced to 0, you must wait a "Shield Restart 
Time" number of turns before the shield will restart at "Recharge Rate" 
strength. If you get hit with a weapon/by melee during that time, you must start 
your "Shield Restart Time" over again. 

    If you don't want to wait that long, at the start of your turn you can pay 
the "Fast Recharge Nanites" cost to restart your shields. Or if your Shield's 
Strength is just damaged, at the start of your turn you can pay the "Fast 
Recharge Nanites" cost to boost the Shield's Strength by an extra "Recharge Rate 
/ Turn" (in other words, 2x "Recharge Rate / Turn" instead of the normal 1x).

Shock:
    When players take more than 70 damage, they must roll a Shock save at a DC 
of the damage taken. On fail they pass out. on success they stay conscious. When 
players fail, they may roll each turn at a DC of 70 to wake up. They continue to 
roll either for (15 - FORT) turns, or until they pass.

Stealth Attacks:
    If you are hidden (undetected by an opponent) when you initiate an attack 
action, you incur bonuses depending on the circumstances of the attack.

    Ranged weapon stealth-attacks (including explosive grenades but not any 
other thrown weapons) have -1 miss chance to hit if 'adequate' aiming time is 
given (DM's discretion: how rushed you are, or how skilled you are at stealth, 
etc). Ranged weapon stealth-attacks gain +20 bonus damage.

    If you stealth-attack a target in melee, your target has a guard DC of 0. As
normal (see section, "melee combat"), if you roll 3+ above your miss chance (3+ above
the opponent's guard DC), you ignore the opponent's armor and deal full damage.
This signifies that the target gets hit in whatever you deem to be the most vulnerable;
i.e., the head, neck, or the chest (over the heart, etc). 

*Base Damage is typically the damage of the weapon without any other character 
bonuses, but Base Damage can be increased by certain classes and abilities.

**Increases to 200 max damage at level 10.

Flanking:
    If you are behind a target, aka flanking, your melee attacks gain +2 bonus 
accuracy against their Guard DC. (Ranged attacks don't gain a specific bonus 
from flanking.)

===== Ranged Combat =====

    If a player or opponent is standing outside of cover and they are shot at, 
after the first firing action (assuming they didn't die or go unconscious), 
they immediately, 'Hit the Dirt'. When you Hit the Dirt, you dive to the ground,
going prone, within a 2m range of where you stood (DEX movement rules apply 
as normal). Hitting the dirt consumes the 1st action of their next turn.

    To fire, you must be within the longest range limit of your gun*, i.e. be at 
a distance smaller than your gun's largest Range Bracket**, and you must not be 
out of ammo. You can aim and fire or, more simply, just fire at a target. If you 
shoot without aiming, you are "Hip Firing" and incur additional aiming penalties 
(see Hip Firing, below). 

*Actually you can fire at any range you like, but you won't necessarily hit anything.
Except for air, you will always hit air (unless you're in space).

**You cannot shoot weapons at a distance of over 100m without magnifying sights 
or over 150m without 2x+ magnification.

    Aiming at an enemy requires one action but significantly increases the 
effectiveness of your fire. Taking aim requires that you select a particular target 
that you can either perceive directly or have a high confidence in its current 
position. You must be able to see or otherwise percieve the target clearly, but they 
do not have to be within your weapon's range. Against this target only, ranged attacks 
follow the normal, non-Hip Fire rules. Characters may cease aiming as a free action, 
for example to aim at a different target. Additionally, aim is ceased automatically 
in any of the following circumstances: 

* The target dies***.
* The target moves a large distance unexpectedly****.
* The aiming character hunkers.
* The aiming character is thrown (for example, by a frag grenade).
* The aiming character suffers impairment to his or her primary sense (such as from a flashbang).

***As an optional rule, if a character's aim target dies, and the death was not 
unexpected, then the character may shift aim to another target within 5m of the first 
as a Free Action. DM discretion is advised for close combat situations.

****Possibly by coming out of cover 5+ meters from the last known location.

    Aiming is relatively simple and does not need to be treated with excessive
formality. If a character could reasonably take or keep aim at something, then he or 
she can.

Fire Rates:
    Most weapons are Semi-Auto, meaning that each time you pull the trigger, the 
gun fires once and chambers a new round automatically. It takes 1 Action to fire 
a semi-auto weapon in this way. Some guns, such as Shotguns and Bolt-Action 
sniper rifles require 2 Actions to fire the gun, where the first Action is a 
trigger pull, and the second Action is the rechambering of the weapon. Some weapons
are capable of higher rates of fire, like Assault Rifles. These weapons often have
more than one fire mode such as Fully-Automatic (Auto) and Burst. Auto or Burst 
mode allows the user to fire 6 or 3 shots for 1 Action, respectively (unless
otherwise noted). 

Rolling a Ranged Attack:
    To hit a target, Players must roll a d10 that is over their weapon's miss 
stat. When an enemy is in cover, their cover score is added to your weapon's 
miss chance. Lets say your normal ranged miss chance is 2, and the enemy is in 
full cover, your miss chance is increased by 4, for a final DC of 6. So a roll 
of 7-10 would be successful.

Gun Jams:
    If at any time that you are firing a gun and you roll a weapon accuracy of 1,
roll a second d10. If that second d10 roll is a 1 or 2, the weapon Jams, 
necessitating a Weapon - [X] Skill check, DC 60.

Hip Firing:
    Add 3 to a weapon's miss chance. You cannot use optical attachments in hip 
firing unless otherwise noted. It is much smarter to takes one action to Aim, 
and spend the rest of your shots firing. It's also a great idea to take an 
action at the end of your turn to "hunker," and gain a +2 cover advantage.

    If your weapon has a minimum distance (usually because of a high-powered
scope), and you fire inside that distance, you are forced to hip fire.

Blind Firing:
    Add 6 to a ranged weapon's miss chances. Blind firing allows you to shoot 
around cover without looking or putting yourself at risk. You can blind fire 
while hunkered. Your blind fire miss chance is affected by your base weapon miss 
chance(s), not affected by attachments unless otherwise noted, reduced by PER 
stat combat bonus (as usual), and reduced by LUCK stat combat bonus. It's 
recommended to calculate this separate miss chance and write it down before 
combat.

Using Cover/Stances:
    Chances are, if an enemy can see you in Compound X, they can hit you. Using 
cover will make you harder to be hit. You will encounter many types of cover 
while adventuring throughout the galaxy. Many small objects provide only partial 
cover, either by partially obscuring your silhouette, or by providing slight 
protection from projectiles. Full cover will do both to a better degree. 
"Partial Cover" typically covers 30-50% of your body, whereas "Full Cover" will 
cover closer to 60-80%. Crouching or going prone will also take better advantage 
of your surroundings and make you a smaller target. Debuffs to opponents' Miss 
Chances are as follows:

No Cover: +0
Partial Cover: +2 
Full Cover: +4
Crouching: +1 (on top of whatever cover you're behind, may completely obscure vision)
Prone: +2* 
Hunkering: +2 (on top of whatever cover you're behind.)

*(on top of whatever -partial- cover you're behind, otherwise, may completely 
obscure vision. Does not provide a bonus against an opponent that is within 5m 
of you if you aren't in cover from their perspective.)

    Crouching is a free action, and standing up costs 1 Action. While you are
crouched, you have -1 movement speed per action (minimum 1) and you cannot
sprint or use other movement abilities.

    Going prone costs 1 Action, and standing up costs 1 Action. Lying flat down on
your chest makes you a smaller target and helps you aim better, but also makes you
easier to hit in melee. -1 gun miss chance while prone and -2 melee Guard DC. Being
prone severely limits your movement: 1/2 movement speed while prone, round-up; maximum
2 movement per action.

    Hunkering costs 1 action, and you cannot fire your weapons except by blind-fire 
(see Blind Firing, above). Imagine curling up in a ball, to pose the absolute smallest
target possible. Its a free action to un-hunker.

Reloading:
    When a gun runs out of ammunition, the user must pause to reload. "But how 
long do I gotta be outta the battle?" Great question!

    Each gun has a "Reload DC," rated based on the complexity and brevity of the 
weapon's reload. For example, an assault rifle, which has a very obvious 
magazine release button and protruding magazine, has an average DC of 30%. More 
complex weapons, such as high-precision sniper systems or exotic sub-machine 
guns might have a higher DC, maybe 40%. If the Player passes the reload, then 
the reload time is standard. For Box-Magazine fed Semi- and Fully-Automatic 
weapons, this is 2 Actions. Other, more complex weapons will specify their 
reload time. On a critical reload success (affected by luck as normal, anything 
in the 90-100 range caused by a raw roll or by adding your Weapon - [X] skill),
the reload time is halved (for Bolt-Actions it is reduced to 1 Action). On a 
failure, the reload time takes twice as long.

== Suppression == 

    Every player with a ranged weapon gets the option to Suppress as the last 
action of their turn. Suppression, also known as, "laying down fire", 
"covering fire", or "suppressive fire" is the art of shooting a hail of 
bullets (as accurately as possible) to try and prevent the enemy from 
effectively fighting back while your team maneuvers. Suppression comes in
three flavors: light, medium, and heavy; these indicate how wide of an area
is suppressed as well as how effective that suppression is (defined below).
The type of suppression available to you is dependent on your weapon.

    When you Suppress, you aim at the target as part of the action and fire a
hail of bullets (within your weapon range). Suppression doesn't require any
rolls to initiate, the suppressor simply fires, creating a light/medium/heavy
suppression AOE (Area-of-Effect, typically a 1-3m circle). Even though Suppression
is an AOE effect, if you cross in-front of someone (someone who is suppressing 
a different person) you will likely trigger automatic attack rolls, DM's discretion.

    If a suppressed target moves out into the open (see below), they 
trigger automatic attack rolls (or automatic hits) by the suppressor, once 
per target per suppressor's turn. If the suppressed target shoots, they 
fire with +1 miss chance, not-stackable. Suppression status can't be purged 
unless you move outside the AOE. The only other way to stop being suppressed 
is to stop the suppressor from using a suppression action on you at the end 
of their turn.

Moving out into the open: 
    In the context of suppression and movement, "moving out into the open" 
includes moving into a new location while you can be hit by shots from the 
suppressor (this excludes moving into complete concealment, such as going prone 
behind a high concrete wall). For example, the following situations would 
trigger a free hit by the suppressor and give you the 'suppressed' status while 
remaining in the area (let's assume you are upright (not crouched or prone)):
moving from partial cover to an adjacent partial cover, moving from complete 
concealment behind a barricade to partial cover, and moving when you are caught 
out in the open.

    If the suppressor cannot physically hit you (such as being completely behind 
an impenetrable barrier) you are not suppressed. The suppressor doesn't need to 
see you to hit you, as in the case of suppressing a cloaked target. 

Light Suppression:
    As the last action of your turn, aim at a target and fire 3 rounds (or the 
rest of your magazine, at least 1 round has to be fired) to suppress 1m radius 
AOE around the target. The target takes a +1 miss chance malus until the start 
of your next turn, and if the target moves out into the open**, then roll an 
immediate reaction to hit the target with a (non-automatic fire) accuracy roll. 
Immediate reactions are stackable on a per-weapon basis.

Medium/Moderate Suppression:
    identical to light suppression with the following exceptions, you must fire 
6 rounds from the current magazine to achieve 'moderate', and you don't have to 
roll to hit -- you automatically hit and roll armor.

Heavy Suppression:
    identical to light suppression with the following exceptions: you must fire 
10 rounds from the current magazine to achieve 'heavy', you don't have to roll 
to hit -- you automatically hit x2 and roll for armor. You suppress all targets 
within a 2m radius AOE around the primary target.


**"Moving out into the open" includes moving into a new location while you can
be hit by shots from the suppressor (this excludes moving into complete concealment,
such as going prone behind a high concrete wall). For example, the following situations
would trigger a free hit by the suppressor and give you the 'suppressed' status
while remaining in the area (let's assume you are upright (not crouched or prone)):
moving from partial cover to an adjacent partial cover, moving from complete concealment
behind a barricade to partial cover, and moving when you are caught out in the open.
    If the suppressor cannot physically hit you (such as being completely behind an 
impenetrable barrier) you are not suppressed. The suppressor doesn't need to see 
you, to hit you.

==============================
Death, Dying, and Downed
==============================

    Oh no! You have less than 1 health point left! What now!?! The good news is 
you are not* dead yet. But you are doing what's known as "bleeding out". The 
first time your character falls below 1 hit point, you get 3 saving throws 
called Death Saving Throws (or 'DSTs' for short). You roll one saving throw per 
turn that you are downed and these DSTs are not modified by any attribute. If you 
succeed a DST, (see 'Downed', below) you continue bleeding out; however, you get 
to roll again next turn. If you fail 3 DSTs, you die. Once you fail a DST, the 
next time you fall below 1 health point you only get 2 DSTs (2 failed throws and 
you die). If you failed a DST during the first two times you were downed and 
you are downed a third time, you only get 1 DST. You regain a DST by going a 
whole encounter without failing a DST. You can have a maximum of 3 saving throws 
at any one time.

Downed:
    The state of having less than one Health Point is called being "downed." It 
is also sometimes called "bleeding out." They are equivalent. While a character 
is downed, they cannot move, cannot stand under their own power, and fall prone 
if not supported by other means. They cannot speak, but can mumble 
incomprehensibly.

    Every turn that a character takes while they are downed, they must make a 
Death Saving Throw of DC 50. Success and failure of these throws is detailed 
above. Even if you had 5 health and took 80 damage, when you go down you go to 0
health. Any additional attacks you sustain will push you into negative health. 

Stabilize:
    As an action, a teammate may bring you back up to 1 health point by succeeding 
on a DC 80 Medicine skill check to stabilize you. Medicine skill, INT mod, and any
bonuses from medical equipment such as medic-kits are added to the roll. Once stabilized,
you may take actions  and speak as normal.

    Don't forget that a recently stabilized character may need  to take actions to
retrieve a dropped weapon or stand back up if they have fallen.

*Some hazards can reduce you to zero health points and kill you 
instantly. Some examples are falling several stories, lava baptisms,
or having a space station dropped on you. Do not do these things. They are
also known to the state of California to cause cancer.
