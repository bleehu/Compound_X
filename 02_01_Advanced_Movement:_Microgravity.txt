Movement in Microgravity
==============================

===== States of Motion =====

	In the absence of gravity, natural and artificial, movement changes 
fundamentally. In Zero-G environments, characters have one of two states at all 
times: Anchored or Drifting. 

Anchored:
	A character is Anchored if he or she is adjacent to and at rest relative 
to a firm surface that weighs at least 5 times as much as the character. 

Drifting:
	A character is Drifting whenever that character is not Anchored.

===== Movement While Anchored =====

	If a character is Anchored to a ferrous surface in a way that permits 
movement, he or she may make movements actions along that surface as if on a 
planetary surface, though accommodation may have to be made for non-flat surfaces. 
Also keep in mind that a character may not have their full speed available, 
depending on their method of Anchor. 

===== Launching =====

	An Anchored character may spend two actions to launch him- or herself away 
from the Anchoring surface. Characters launching in this way enter the Drifting 
state with their standard movement speed and a direction of their choice. 

	Characters may also be launched by certain events, such as explosives going 
off nearby or the Anchored object being struck by a ship weapon. In those cases, 
the character has an optional reflex save based on the force of the event to avoid 
being Launched – failure causes the character to be Launched directly away from the 
incoming force as described below.

Small explosives or Blunt Melee Strike: 1m per 2 actions and 40 Reflex per 30 points of damage
Demolition explosives or Vehicle/Ship Weapon: 8m per 2 actions and 50 Reflex per 30 hull points of damage

	A character may spend an Action to Brace for Impact, which grants Advantage
on any Reflex saves to avoid being Launched until the character takes another Action.

	In the case that the Anchoring surface is a capital ship, station, or 
similarly high-inertia object, characters are not Launched by strikes against the 
surface that are more than 50m away except in truly calamitous circumstances, at 
the DM’s discretion.

	In the case that a character would be Launched toward an adjacent solid 
object, such as the surface they were Anchored to, that character may make a DC 120 
reflex save to catch themselves (Anchoring equipment may provide bonuses), in which 
case they become Anchored again but gain the prone state. Failure causes the character 
to Bounce uncontrolledly. If the Launching event was not a surprise, the character may 
choose to Bounce instead of rolling the Reflex Save, and may control the direction of 
the Bounce by succeeding on a difficulty 80 Acrobatics check. Failure reverts to an 
uncontrolled Bounce.

== Bouncing ==

	Characters may only Bounce if they are Drifting, otherwise the Launching 
rules apply.

	Uncontrolled Bouncing halves the character’s speed alters his or her 
direction based on the angle of impact.

	Controlled Bouncing reduces the character's speed by one meter per two 
actions and alters his or her direction away from the surface of the character's 
choice. Any attempt to controlled Bounce incurs an Acrobatics check, described
below in Movement While Drifting.

===== Movement While Drifting =====

	If a character has a thruster pack or some other means of propulsion, he or she 
is treated as a Strikecraft while not Anchored, and follows Strikecraft movement rules.

	While Drifting, a character has a speed and a direction. Each turn, the 
character is forced to travel four Actions worth of distance at this speed in this 
direction. This movement does not require expenditure of Actions. 

	If in a pressurized location, a character loses 1 meter per two actions of 
speed at the end of every turn spent drifting.

	If a character would impact a surface that he or she is capable of Anchoring 
to, he or she may make an Acrobatics check to Anchor to it. The save is based on 
many factors, enumerated in the next subsection. Passing the check allows the 
character to Anchor to the surface and gain the prone state, while succeeding the 
check by 20 or more makes going prone optional. Failing the save results in an 
uncontrolled Bounce. Bouncing also resets any weapons fire modifiers for future 
Anchoring attempts. A Character may always choose to controlled Bounce instead of 
Anchoring, in which case the check's difficulty is halved.

== Anchoring Acrobatics Check Difficulty Modifiers ==

Surface Texture:
Smooth Surface: 0
Rough or Curved Surface: +20
Damaged Surface: +40

Speed:
Speed equal or less than the character’s Movement Speed: -20
Speed greater than twice the character’s Movement Speed: +15 * Speed / Movement Speed

Angle of Impact:
Less than 30 degrees: -15
Between 30 and 60 degrees: 0
Greater than 60 degrees: +30

Non-recoilless Weapons Usage:
Ballistic weapon: +30 per action spent firing
Plasma weapon: +15 per action spent firing

Anchoring Equipment:
	As described in the Item entry.

== Collision ==

	If two Drifting characters collide, they may Anchor to each other (treat as a 
grapple attempt if one party is unwilling, failure causes both characters to 
uncontrolled Bounce off of each other). If successful, the two characters are still 
Drifting, but now have the same direction and speed. Collision physics realism is at 
the DM’s discretion – for maximum simplicity you may give the combined characters the 
speed and direction of whichever character had greater initial momentum.

	A Drifting character may collide with an Anchored character. If the Anchored 
character is willing, the Drifting character may Anchor to the same surface with an 
Acrobatics check at half the usual difficulty. Otherwise, the colliding character 
must succeed on a grapple attempt to Anchor to the surface (no Acrobatics check involved).
Failure causes the colliding character to Bounce uncontrolledly, and Launches the Anchored
character directly toward the surface, triggering a possible Reflex save to Anchor as 
described in the Launching section.

	Characters may make an Acrobatics check to Launch themselves with intent to 
collide with another character. The check scales with distance to and speed of the 
target (starting at Difficulty 0) as described below. Note that if the target changes 
their speed or direction while the character is in flight, the collision might not occur.

Every 10m of path to target: Difficulty +20
Every 4m per two actions of target's speed: Difficulty +30

===== Microgravitic Character Movement at Space Combat Scale =====

	At ship-scale, Launched characters stay in the same square as the ship or station 
they launched from. Such characters will maintain the speed and direction of the ship they 
launched from at the time they launched from it, basically regardless of actions taken, as 
humanoids are much, much smaller than ships. See the sidebar about centripetal force for 
optional rules to handle characters that launch from a ship during a turn.

	Whether ground- or ship-scale apply to a particular volume (such as the space 
between two relatively near ships) is at the DM’s discretion.

	For health and safety reasons (including the general disinclination of most species 
towards being violently and painfully torn apart), insufficiently protected characters are 
**strongly discouraged** from passing through gravitic shielding.

	A note: similar ship shield layers are sympathetic, and when they would intersect 
they instead stitch together into one larger layer. Therefore you don’t need personal 
antigrav to breach enemy shields if you can get your own shielded craft close enough.

===== A Note On Intersecting Advanced Movement Rules =====

	If a character is in Zero-G and underwater at the same time (or other liquid), 
underwater rules take precedence.
