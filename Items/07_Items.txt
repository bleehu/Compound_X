damaged. Replacing them is expensive, but not impossible. Please note that 
buying an extruder does not mean that one knows how to use it to follow 
Engineer processes; i.e., a Gunslinger who buys an extruder can't construct
IEDs with it.

    A 3m^3 framework that will build a rudimentary  3d image of whatever is 
inside it, exportable to a portable device.

from multiple angles to capture the whole object. Up to 20m^3 of space.

except on the soles of the feet and the gloves. The inner lining is waterproof
and airtight. The material makes a crinkling sound that gives a -20 to stealth
checks. Wearing the suit correctly provides immunity to airborne gas attack or
infection. For example, provides immunity from tear gas, The Doctor's

wearer takes damage the suit ruptures and no longer provides immunity.

be on the lookout for shops or characters who might sell you more things. If you

available and how much it might cost. Equipment that you start with generally
depends on your character's fist mission.
