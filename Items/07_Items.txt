==============================
Tools
==============================

Dog Toy ($20):
    This brightly colored rubber ball is available in both the squeaking and 
not-squeaking varieties. Very Bouncy and great for tricks like fetch.

Plasma cutter / Blow Torch ($450):
    Cut through steel, aluminum, etc unless it is specifically a hardened 
object. Cut through up to 1 inch of steel in 2 full turns, 2 inches in 3 full 
turns. A basic 2-inch thick chain link would take 3 turns to cut through. To 
open a man-sized hole in 1 inch thick steel would take 10 full turns.

Door Ram ($300): 
    When using this ram, add 50 to Athletics checks to kick open doors. Must
have STR 8 to carry or use.

Bolt Cutters ($80):
    Used to cut through chain links, locks, cables, etc.

Fishing Pole ($120):
    A sturdy, 2m long fiberglass fishing pole with a reel, fishing line and a
sharp hook. Bait not included. An expert angler could potentially cast this out
to 6 meters.  

Fire Extinguisher ($115):
	A handheld cylindrical trigger-based vessel with two mag slots, 
one for a pressurized fire suppressing agent and one for a pressurized 
propellant. Can be used to put out sources of fire and has a range of 
4m. Requires both hands to operate. Not recommended for use on anything 
other than a fire. Comes with one Extinguisher Magazine set already loaded.

Extinguisher Magazine Set ($40):
	A set of two magazines for the Fire Extinguisher; one
of fire suppressant and one of propellant. One set can cover 15m total 
when used in the extunguisher.

Pneumatic Door Press ($700):
    Opens sliding, pneumatically controlled doors up to Militarized Level 
(airlock specific doors exluded)

Engineer's replacement Extruder Tool ($670):
    Sometimes things happen and an engineer's favorite tool gets lost, stolen or 
damaged. Replacing them is expensive, but not impossible. Please note that 
buying an extruder does not mean that one knows how to use it to follow 
Engineer processes; i.e., a Gunslinger who buys an extruder can't construct
IEDs with it.

3D image builder, Static ($650):
    A 3m^3 framework that will build a rudimentary 3d image of whatever is 
inside it, exportable to a portable device.

3D image builder, Portable ($800):
    Builds a 3D image of what its being pointed at, will need to see the object 
from multiple angles to capture the whole object. Up to 20m^3 of space.
	
Medical Nanites Booster Shot ($400):
	A partial unit of Medical Nanites. The booster shot is a standard 
medical procedure on more affluent worlds, like a vaccine, and provides 
resistance to and faster healing from disease and injury. Characters with a 
nanite booster shot gain +10 to Shock saves and benefit from faster healing 
during Short Rests (see Resting in the Basic Rules).
	Additional boosters after the first have no effect. A booster shot 
may be upgraded to a Medical Nanites Unit (see below) at a cost of $700.
	
Medical Nanites Unit ($1000):
	One unit of Medical Nanites. Having at least one unit of Medical Nanites 
provides all the benefits of a booster shot (see above), with even more potent 
rest healing. Additionally, full units of medical nanites can be harnessed to 
execute Active Feats (see Feats in the Basic Rules).
	Additional units after the first do not provide more healing or increase 
the save bonus, but may be used to execute more active feats in shorter time 
frames. The maximum number of Units a character can have at once is related to 
their level - see the leveling table.
	Reputable physicians will not administer additional units of medical 
nanites unless the previous one has had at least 3 weeks of time to assimilate. 
Failure to observe this limit will cause severe health problems as the different 
batches of nanites identify each other as foreign invaders and wreak havoc.

==============================
Wearables
==============================

Dog Harness ($45):
    This harness comes with up to 18 characters of monogram and a micro
chip that helps you find your dog if it runs away. The harness itself is 
lightweight and a little bit stretchy to prevent irritating the wearer. Also
comes with a 3m leash. 

Night Vision Goggles ($300):
    IR visibility for low light conditions. Resolution clouds after 100m.

Gas Mask ($300):
    Prevents the inhalation of noxious or toxic air-borne compunds. Reduce PER 
based rolls (including strike rolls) by 10.

Hazmat Suit, Disposable ($60):
    A white unitard that covers over your hands, feet, arms, legs, body and 
head. The suit zips up in the back and has a elastic drawstring that fits around
a gas mask or rebreather. The outer layer of the suit has a no-stick covering
except on the soles of the feet and the gloves. The inner lining is waterproof
and airtight. The material makes a crinkling sound that gives a -20 to stealth
checks. Wearing the suit correctly provides immunity to airborne gas attack or
infection. For example, provides immunity from tear gas, The Doctor's 
Contaminate Area Procedure, etc. The suit provides no armor coverage and if the
wearer takes damage the suit ruptures and no longer provides immunity.

Opaleite Water Visor ($50):
    A set of watertight goggles with a low-power filtration system and 
rechargeable battery. When filled with water, an Opaleite wearing 
the visor no longer suffers from racial Perception penalties from 
being out of water. Provides no benefit to non-Opaleites.

    Due to its bulk, wearing the visor precludes wearing any helmets or 
other sizeable headgear.

Military Opaleite Water Visor ($150):
    A compacted water visor with a streamlined filtration system.
When filled with water, an Opaleite wearing the visor no longer 
suffers from racial Perception penalties from being out of water. 
Provides no benefit to non-Opaleites.

    Because of the streamlined profile, wearing the visor does not preclude 
wearing any helmets or other sizeable headgear.

organic character who is bleeding out. The syringe does not heal the character 
or stabilize them. The character's Death Saving Throws are all reset as if that
character had succeeded on all of their Death Saving Throw rolls. This syringe
does not require a medicine check; the device measures out the appropriate 
dosage automatically.

==============================
Miscellaneous Items
==============================

    Examples of RP trinkets include cigarettes, a lighter, cards, a wallet, an 
ID pass, etc. Basically items that cannot be used in combat, but would have 
great value in RP. These cost nothing, but you can only have a maximum of 2 
items at start.

    Other misc. items are available for sale in the world. While you're playing 
be on the lookout for shops or characters who might sell you more things. If you
want to buy other starting equipment, ask your DM if something specific is 
available and how much it might cost. Equipment that you start with generally
depends on your character's fist mission. 

20m of Nylon Rope ($30):
    A light, sturdy rope 20 meters long which can hold a tension of 400lbs 
without snapping.

Trulight LED flashlight	($22):

Adhesive Foam ($45):
	A spray can with a nozzle on the end that sprays a chemical
solution in either an area or a thin line. As the solution dries, 
it expands and hardens to accomodate the space given. Can be used
to insulate an area, temporarily patch up a damaged wall, 
seal ducts, etc. One can has 1 cubic meter's worth of foam.

Solvent ($45):
	A spray can with a nozzle on the end that sprays a chemical
solution in an area. When this solution comes into contact with
adhesive foam or similar substances, they will dissolve into a vapor.
One can has 1 cubic meter's worth of solvent.

Basic Storage Crate ($125):
	A 1mx1mx1m metal crate secured with an electronic keypad.

Firestarter Kit ($95):
	A set of flint, steel, matches and sealed hexamine fuel
tablets in a waterproof container. Can be used to light a fire.

False Fauna ($230):
	A remote-controlled drone designed to appear and sound 
like a small animal. The drone is equipped with a camera that the 
operator can see out of with a display set into the controller.
The controller can transmit its signal to the drone over a 
maximum range of 600m before the signal is lost. A DC 70 
Spotting skill check can identify it for what it truly is. A
DC 60 Hacking skill check can relay the visual feed to the 
hacker's display while a DC 90 Hacking skill check will hijack
the device entirely.

Shovel ($70):
	A hand tool with a broad blade typically used for digging, 
lifting and moving bulk material such as soil, ore, snow and sand.

Vibroshovel ($130):
	A shovel built with a compacted ultrasonic oscillation
generator in the handle. When activated, the generator causes the
blade of the shovel to vibrate at a fast speed. This decreases
the time it can take to excavate material to half the normal rate.

Comfy Bed Roll ($55):
    An insulated and padded bedroll. Great for missions which last more than a
couple of days. Not rated for temperatures above 43 degrees C or below -5 C.

Walkie-Talkie ($45):
    A simple 30 channel push to talk hand held radio. Has a 2km range. Comes 
with a handy clip to attach to a belt or combat harness. Simple encryption can
be broken with a DC 45 Hacking skill check.

Radio Headset ($65):
    A slightly more sophistocated communication system. Fits well under most 
combat helmets and is available in different sizes for most races or species.
Uses passive filtering to reduce background noise. Capable of broadcasting
while receiving. Better encryption means it takes a DC 64 Hacking check
to listen in. DC 78 Hacking check of to make a call on an enemy line. Range of 3km.

Integrated Remote Verbal Communication Module ($80):
    Cybernetic customers such as cyborgs or Security Droids may purchase and
install an integrated radio broadcasting module. These have a range of 2km
and a Hacking DC of 82, since they can use the host's own encryption 
hardware.

Subdermal Mic ($230):
    The best combat communication system available on the public market. A
microphone is actually injected under the users' skin and rests next to the
combatant's jaw bone. It uses the vibration of the jaw to send clear voice
sounds even over cacophanous gunfire. A similar speaker is injected in the
back of the cheek near the ear. Impossible to see with the naked eye without 
invading the wearer's personal space. Hacking DC of 140.

Universal Translation Device ($160):
    The Universal Translation Device is proprietary and fairly rare. A character
will likely have a hard time finding them for purchase until level 10.
    A small cell-phone sized device with a small screen, camera, speaker and
universal audio port. It can interface with any of the radio systems above or be
used in ambient mode where it repeats anything it hears ambiently in the 
language that it is set to. In synch mode, the translator listens to both its 
mic and the coms that it is tied into and pipes the translated voices to the 
com's speaker. This means that the translations piped to a subdermal mic can
only be heard by the person using it but the translations piped to a 
walkie-talkie might be overheard.
    A given universal translator can only hold 10 languages at a time while 
offline from the net cortex, and can slowly learn a language as it hears it, but
will have a very hard time translating a previously unknown language.
    Hacking the device requires physical access unless it is attached to a pwned 
device. In either the case of physical access or connection to a pwned device, 
the Hacking DC to disrupt is 50 and to pwn is 90. A Disrupted translator will only 
broadcast static in place of foreign languages, a pwned translator will spoof 
words that the hacker has programmed.
