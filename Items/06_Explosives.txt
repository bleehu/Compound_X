===== Level 1 Requirement Weapons =====

== ECSC Smoke Grenade $50 ==

Damage: D10 Thermal Damage to exact spot of impact
Miss Chance: 5
Range: 10+[DEX or STR]*2 meters
Armor Piercing Level: 0
Reflex Modifier: -10
Reflex Save: 110

    Rolling higher than a 9 Miss Chance causes a direct hit. For a circle of 10m 
radius, all targets are now in stealth at 80%. Anyone looking in or out of smoke 
must make a PER roll of 81% or higher (disregarding bonuses) in order to fire 
through smoke. Targets that are adjacent need not abide by this rule (including 
one target outside the circle adjacent to a target inside the circle). If you 
are fully behind the smoke and a target is on the complete opposite side, the 
smoke completely obscures your vision, leaving you with a perception check of 
120% in order to see all the way through the smoke. Smoke lasts for 12 Rounds or 
2 minutes.

    Each character in the radius of a Smoke Grenade's range when it goes off may
make a Reflex Save of DC 110. If they succeed, they may dive prone up to their
speed for one action in the direction of their choice. Choosing to do so comes
at the cost of one action on their next turn.

    10m radius cloud of choking chemicals. anyone caught in the circle suffers 
the following effects: partial blindness due to uncontrollable tears (+30% to 
hit), coughing fits (-50% stealth), and take 10 internal damage per round spent in 
the cloud. Targets can negate all effects with a gas mask. Targets who leave the 
cloud will continue to exhibit partial blindness for 3 Rounds after leaving the 
fog, and coughing for 6 Rounds. Gas cloud persists for 2 Rounds after initial 
detonation.

    Each character in the radius of a CID Grenade's range when it goes off may
make a Reflex Save of DC 90. If they succeed, they may dive prone up to their
speed for one action in the direction of their choice. Choosing to do so comes

    All characters who sense light in the same room as the detonation or 
within 10m of it, whichever is shorter, must succeed on a DC 85 Awareness save 
or gain the blind condition for two rounds. Each round that the character remains 
blind, they may retry the save once per round at the end of their turn.

    Each character in the radius of a flash-bang's range when it goes off may
make a Reflex Save of DC 110. If they succeed, they are able to shield their
eyes or optical sensors sufficiently to avoid being totally stunned. Instead of
being blinded, they simply suffer a -20% penalty to perception, spotting, or
investigation checks.
