Weapon Attachments
==============================

    These weapon accessories either increase the performance of your weapon, or
add more functionality to it. For more information on weapon attachments, see 
the "Weapon Customization" section of the Basic Rules.

==============================
Optics / Aiming Aids
==============================

    Optics and aiming aid attachments typically go on the top rail and are what
your character looks through to see where their shots will go when they squeeze
the trigger.

===== Level 1 Requirement =====

== Tritium Glow Iron Sights  $150 ==

    A metalic notch on the rear of the rail with a small metal post toward the
muzzle, that serve as a simple way of lining up your shots. These particular 
metal sights have a streak of tritium paint on them so they glow softly like the 
marks on an old watch. 1x magnification, but allows for much better target 
acquisition. Can be mounted on 45 degree mounts in addition to a scope in order 
to negate a minimum engagement distance penalty.

    Range Bracket Miss Chance: -0.5

== Grenade Launcher Iron Sights  $400 ==

    1x Magnification. Allows better estimation of distances. Folds down for 
compatibility with magnified optics or dot-sites for the primary weapon. Can be 
used along side other weapon sites, but not the Tritium Glow Iron Sites (If 
grenade launcher is not an underbarrel attachment, disregard). 

    Grenade Launcher ranged miss chance: -0.5

== 1x Dot Sight  $350 ==

    Your basic tube-shaped dot-projection. Dot can be changed from 
blue-green-red for various lighting situations and terrains.

    Miss Chance reduction (in all Range Brackets) vary by weapon type as listed 
below.

*  -1 for Pistols
*  -0.5 other.
*  +3m R3 Range

== 1x Reflex Sight  $500 ==

    A reflectively-projected site, comprised of a light source and a single pane 
of rectangular glass. Allows for less F.O.V. and parallax distortions. Has a 
small cross, chevron, or dot as the indicator.

==============================
Assistance Attachments
==============================

    You may only have one type of laser, and maximum of two total of the 
following.

===== Level 1 Requirement =====

== Flashlight  $60 ==

    A small but powerful flashlight that clips to the underside of your gun 
barrel. It comes with a small on/off switch that sits close to the fire select
and saftey switches of your weapon. When on, it provides 30m visibility in dark,
but gives a -40 penalty to stealth checks. Can be turned on or off as a free
action, as long as your character didn't also adjust their fire mode as a free
action this turn as well. In the case where you're adjusting fire mode and 
flashlight in the same turn, your adjustments add up to cost an Action.

== IR flashlight  $480 ==

    Just like a flashlight, but it only emits light in the infra-red bandwidth,
and so is invisible to anyone without IR cameras or goggles. Provides 30m of 
visibility in the dark with IR vision.

== Red Laser  $250 ==
    
    A small laser pointer that clips under the barrel of your gun and has been
adjusted to roughly show where bullets go when you squeeze the trigger. 

    Hip Fire Miss Chance Penalty: -2 out to 25m

== Green Laser  $350 ==
    
    A small laser pointer that clips under the barrel of your gun and has been
adjusted to roughly show where bullets go when you squeeze the trigger.

    Hip Fire Miss Chance Penalty: -1 out to 80m

== Range Finder  $740 ==

    A small screen that digitially notifies the user of the target's range. It
measures the range using an infrared laser beam and sensor. Useful for 
calculated bullet drop for a sniper. Negates one of the actions used to adjust 
scope windage and elevation due to distance. May be used in conjunction with an
IR laser at a discount of 500 credits.

== IR Laser  $900 ==
    
    A small laser pointer that clips under the barrel of your gun and has been
adjusted to roughly show where bullets go when you squeeze the trigger. Must be 
used with IR vision. Can also be used to paint a target for Airstrikes or 
Orbital Strikes out to 150m.

    Hip Fire Miss Chance Penalty: -2 out to 80m

===== Level 10 Requirement =====

== Blue Laser  $800 ==
    
    A small laser pointer that clips under the barrel of your gun and has been
adjusted to roughly show where bullets go when you squeeze the trigger.

    Hip Fire Miss Chance Penalty:  -2 out to 90m

== Focused Heartbeat Monitor  $1500 ==

    a pair of baffled and filtered microphones that detect heartbeats and 
determine the approximate distance and direction to the heartbeat using clever
techniques like phase shift analysis and parallax effect detection. 

    Range Bracket Miss Chance: -1 when firing at organic targets behind cover 
within 20m

==============================
Muzzle Attachments
==============================

===== Level 1 Requirement =====

== Bayonet Mount  $100 ==
    Can affix a knife to your gun. Allows you to use your knife without having 
to put down your gun and draw it.

== Recoil Compensator (Muzzle Brake)  $500 ==
    Reduces Recoil from the gun, allowing for more accurate follow-up shots. 
Also increases muzzle flash, making you easier to spot at a distance when 
firing.

    Using the recoil compensator gives an Auto and Burst Miss Chance -0.5 which 
does not apply to lasers, coilguns or plasma guns.

== Flash / Sound Suppressor  $900 ==
Greatly reduces the muzzle flash and some of the weapon report from firing. 
Targets are not likely to see you or hear you when not particularly looking for
you. When alerted to your presence, they are 60% less likely to find your 
position. Only applies to ballistic weapons. Not usable on coilguns, shotguns, 
or Machine Guns.

Auto and Burst Miss Chance: -0.5 
R3 Range: +4m

== Improved Flash / Sound Suppressor  $1400 ==
    Completely removes muzzle flash and the weapon report. Targets cannot locate 
you due to firing your weapon. Only applies to ballistic weapons. Not usable on 
coilguns, shotguns, or Machine Guns.

Auto and Burst Miss Chance: -0.5 
R3 Range: +8m

===== Level 10 Requirement =====

== Heavy Recoil Compensator  $900 ==

    Larger, and with actuating pistons, the heavy recoil compensator distributes 
recoil energy over a longer period of time. Auto and Burst Miss Chance:  -1 

== BE Meyers Spektor suppressor  $2000 ==

    Completely removes muzzle flash and the weapon report. Targets cannot locate 
you due to firing your weapon. Only applies to ballistic weapons. Not usable on 
coilguns, shotguns, or Machine Guns.

Ranged Miss Chance: -0.5 
R3 Range: +12m

==============================
Barrel Replacements
==============================

===== Level 1 Requirement =====

== Light Profile Barrel  $720 ==

Ranged Miss Chance: +0.5
Strength Requirement: -1
Carry Strength Bonus: +0.5 (cancels out movement speed penalties)
Weapon Reflex Modifier: +5

== Heavy Profile Barrel  $720 ==

    This heavier barrel reduces recoil, increases the accuracy of follow-up shots.

Ranged Miss Chance: -1 @ Range Brackets R2 & R3 (and a -1 to R4 if relevant)
Movement Speed Penalty: -1m
Weapon Reflex Modifier: -8

===== Level 10 Requirement =====

== Magnetic Accelerator Field  $1500 ==

    This barrel is ringed with a series of flip-flop capacitors that very 
quickly magnitize and inverse polarity to reinforce, spin and accelerate the 
electro-magnetic envelope containing a plasma round. The effect is a plasma 
round that imparts more of its energy onto the target, resulting in higher 
damage. This attachment can only be used on plasma weapons.

    Weapon Damage:  +10% (Drop the remainder)


== Improved Focal Lensing  $1500 ==

    A barrel with laser focusing lenses made from crystal more pure than the 
typical stock, and which have been machined within much closer tolerances. The
effect is a laser beam that is much better focused, so it delivers its energy
more effeciently. This attachment can only be put on laser weapons.

    Weapon Damage:  +10% (Drop the remainder) or +5, whichever is higher.

==============================
Lower Rail attachments
==============================

===== Level 1 Requirement =====

== Bipod  $900 ==
    Increases weapon stability when deployed. 1 Action is required to deploy the 
bipod. Free action to disengage. To Deploy, you must be near an object you can 
rest your gun on, or you must be prone. Having the bipod deployed does not 
impair use of weapon, but will make holstering the weapon or moving through 
confined spaces more difficult. After disengaging, user must still take 1 Action 
to deploy. 

    Cannot be used with an underbarrel weapon.

Only when deployed: -2 Auto and Burst Miss Chance.
Only when deployed: -1 R3 & R2 Miss Chance.

== Vertical Foregrip $500 ==

    A simple handle under the barrel of your gun that increases weapon 
stability when firing lots of bullets quickly.

    Auto Miss Chance:  -1
    Burst Miss Chance: -1

== Angled Foregrip $600 ==

    Easier to grip and somehow aim the weapon better for long periods of time 
than a vertical Foregrip.

    Gun takes an additional -6 reflex modifier. To Breach a door, the user must 
pass a DC 20 hit roll a number of times equal to the door''s DC / 20. This style 
of breaching only applies to traditionally hinged doors, GM's discretion. All 
other rules are the same as a standard shotgun. Only usable with buckshot.

===== Level 10 Requirement =====

== Grip-pod  $1200 ==

    Increases held weapon stability, and contains a bipod for augmented 
stability. 1 Action is required to deploy the bipod. Free action to disengage. 
To Deploy, you must be near an object you can rest your gun on, or you must be 
prone. Having the bipod deployed does not impair use of weapon, but will make 
holstering the weapon or moving through confined spaces more difficult.

    Cannot be used with an underbarrel weapon.

At all times: -2 Auto and Burst Miss Chance.
Only when deployed: -1 R3 & R2 Miss Chance.

== SPECO Under-Barrel Chainsaw SPC100  	$607.77 ==
    Enemy a little too close for comfort? Allows the user to enter melee combat 
without needing to switch out their primary weapon for a melee weapon. (This 
weapon follows normal melee rules as stated in the basic rules). The 
under-barrel chainsaw is considered an Exotic (Light) weapon, and as such 
requires the feat Proficiency: Exotic Melee Weaponry (Chainsaw) to operate. 
The weight of the chainsaw adds +1 to the Weapon Strength Requirement of the 
weapon it is mounted on.

Damage:		   70 + 2x Dexterity, 2x Bleed
Range:     	   Adjacent (1m)
Accuracy Modifier: +1

    Requires the feats Proficiency: Exotic Melee Weaponry (Chainsaw) to operate. +1 to the Weapon Strength 
Requirement of the weapon you mount the Chainsaw on.

==============================
Slings
==============================

===== Level 1 Requirement =====

== Pistol Lanyard  $100 ==

    If you drop your pistol, it'll fall harmlessly to your leg level instead of 
dropping onto the ground. Holstering your weapon is a free action. Drawing your
pistol takes 1 extra Action next time*.

*If you have 'Quickdraw' and/or 'Pistol Quickdraw' you only need to take 1 
Action to draw instead of 2.

== Two Point Sling $350 ==

    Cannot be used with pistols. You can use your sling to stabilize your grip 
arm. Allows you to carry the gun on your back. 

    Range Bracket Miss Chance:  -0.5

== One Point Sling $300 ==

    Cannot be used with pistols. Due to the positioning of the weapon, you can 
draw your primary as a free action. Holstering your weapon is a free action.

    Strength Requirement:  -1

===== Level 5 Requirement =====

== Three Point Smart-Sling $650 ==

    Cannot be used with pistols. Normally thought of as something you would 
cut-off your gun and throw away, the three point smart-sling uses 
electric-textile(TM) to manage the tension and fabric length of your sling. 
This allows three point slings to be used without getting caught on your gear.

    Due to the positioning of the weapon, you can draw your primary as a Free 
Action. Allows you to carry the gun on your back. Holstering your weapon is a 
Free Action.

Strength Requirement:  -1
Range Bracket Miss Chance:  -0.5

===== Level 10 Requirement =====

== Pistol Smart-Lanyard Holster System  $250 ==

    Dropping your weapon holsters it as free action. Drawing it takes 1 Action 
as normal.

==============================
Ammunition / Magazine Accessories
==============================

===== Level 1 Requirement =====

== Extended Magazines  $(1.3x) Mag cost. ==

     $12 mags now cost $15, etc. Round Up. Adds 30% magazine capacity to 
magazine/clip-based weapons. Revolver systems or rocket launchers, for example, 
are excluded.

== Hollow Point Magazine  $1.5x + 10 mag cost ==

    Hollow point ammunition are bullets that have either a hollow tip or a tip
with water inside. This makes the bullet fragment more dramatically on impact,
which means that it penetrates armor less effectively. However, if it hits 
something squishy like fruit, a person's body or the delicate silicone and boron
of a security drone, it shreds it much more effectively.

Base damage: +30%
Armor Piercing Level: -1

== Armor Piercing Magazine  $1.5x + 10 mag cost ==

    Armor piercing rounds are made of heavier metal that doesn't fragment as
easily on impact. This means that it is much more likely to go through armor.
However, this also means that it is likely to go in one side of a soft target
and out of the other, which typically damages soft targets like people a lot 
less.

Armor Piercing Level: +1
Base Damage: -10%

== ED Electric Discharge Magazine  $2x + 20 magazine cost ==

    ED rounds contain what basically amounts to a capacitor and electrolytic
chaff. When the round hits, it shocks whatever it hits. But this chaff does 
little to fragment the way that conventional bullets do. 

Balistic Damage: -50% of base damage
Electric Damage: +50% of base damage

== Overcharge Laser Capacitors $(1.5 x mag cost) ==

    Most common laser weapons have after-market ammunition batteries available
that exceed the recommended voltage for compatibility with that gun. The result
is a weapon system that imparts more damage through a higher intensity laser, at
the cost of running the risk of overheating the emitter manifold and causing the
weapon to "jam." Or in the worst case scenario, to overload even those safety
measures and to cause the weapon to slag, rendering the weapon inoperable and 
potentially physically burning the user. This attachment is only usable with
lasers.

Cost: $1.5 x normal mag
Damage: +15%
Jam Range: + 2 on second roll after rolling a 1

== Poison Bullet Magazine  $2x + 50 magazine cost ==
    Your bullet's new damage = 0.9x bullet base damage + stackable poison 
effect based on base bullet damage (before base damage reduction): 
0-60 damage = lesser poison for 2 Rounds, 61-110 = poison for 2 Rounds,
111+ = greater poison for 2 Rounds. Target cannot roll normal saving throws
against the poison. Poison damage is taken at the end of the turn of the 
afflicted character.

== RMM Match (Tournament) Grade Ammo  2x mag cost ==

    This high quality ammunition isn't cheap, but it increases the consistency 
of your shots. 

    Ranged Miss Chance:  -0.5

== High Velocity Ammunition  2.2x mag cost ==

    High Velocity Ammo uses slightly more dense metal and extra propellant to
make bullets that just go faster. This helps the ammo fly straighter and impart
more energy to what it collides with.

Longest Range Bracket:  +10%m or +5m (whichever is higher)
Base Damage:  +10% (drop the remainder)

== Magpulls  +$10 per primary magazine, +$5 per secondary magazine ==

    Decrease the Reload DC by 5% for any box magazines. Must be purchased
for each individual magazine. Can be used with any weapon that use box magazines.

===== Level 10 Requirement =====

== Drum Mag  $2.5x + 30 mag cost ==

    Increases the capacity of your weapon by a substantial 250% increase. Takes 
up twice the space in your magazine inventory as a standard magazine.

    This attachment can only be used with weapons that have box-fed magazines 
[not belt-fed], SMGs, Carbines, and shotguns.

== Baffled Ammo ($1.5 x mag cost) ==

    This sabot-discarding ammo has baffled edges so that it barely makes any
noise as it travels through the air. There is no zip or snap noise as bullets
whiz by or into targets. 

    Using Baffled ammo in your weapon reduces the range of your R3 bracket by
10m and reduces the damage of your weapon by 5 damage. Stealth rolls to hide
silent weapons fire automatically succeed. A bullet impact can be heard if a
character is within 5m of the impact, alert and makes an Investigate(PER) check
over DC 50.

== Gluon Rounds ($2.5 x mag cost) ==

    Gluon rounds use a web of inseparable gluon entangled particles to make a
round that won't fragment no matter what it hits. That means that it delivers
all of its energy to one point, which helps penetrate armor even better than
traditional AP rounds. But it also means that it won't break up to damage soft
tissue as effectively. 

    Using gluon rounds adds 1 to your weapon's AP level. Gluon rounds deal 
triple damage to the AS of any armor they hit, but deal 15% less damage to the 
HP of any character they hit.

== Short Circuit Rounds ($1.5 x mag cost) ==

    Short circuit rounds are specifically designed to damage cybernetic targets.
They contain a hyperconductive solute that bonds with most known insulators.
The combination of puncture wounds from the round itself and the chemical 
electric connections from the solute have the nasty effect of routing power and
signals where they least belong. Since the solute has less density than the 
metal that rounds are normally made of, they typically deal less damage to 
biologic targets and armor.

    The net effect is that using Short Circuit rounds lowers the damage dealt
by each shot by 20 points, but if the round hits the health pool of a cybernetic
target, it deals an extra 45 damage.

== Flechette Shells ($2.5 x mag cost) ==

	Flechette (Fle - shet) shells are a shotgun only spreading shot, which contains 
flight sustaining, titanium alloy darts. They are quite effective at weakening flesh
and circuitry, and can pierce through materials to reach its target. These particular 
type of pointed bits are great at travelling short distances, but lose trajectory 
the greater the distance. 

When using Flechette shells, increase damage 40% when shots pierce or miss armor. 
When in use, the APL of weapon is increased by 1. Gain +10m to R1, -5m to R2, and a -10m to R3. 
All damage dealt to armor with these rounds deal 50% damage. Because of the range modifiers, R1 
holds priority over the other brakets. For example, if R1 becomes 20m, and R2 becomes 15m, then 
R1 is what will be used, and R2 will be disrarded entirely. If R3 does this as well, then R1 or 
R2 will be used in its place, depending on which range R3 overlaps with. If any of the range 
brackets are the same, the lowest bracket will be used. Ex: R1 instead of R2/R3, R2 instead of R3.

== Shredder Rounds ($2 x mag cost) ==

    Shredder rounds contain metal fragments which splinter into hyperkinetic
shrapnel upon impact. These fragments spread the energy out upon impact, and
thus are not great against armor, but tear up soft tissue or fragile technology
mercilessly.

    Using Shredder Rounds reduces the APL of your weapon by 1. Deals an 
additional 30% damage as long as your weapon has a higher APL than the target's
armor or if it doesn't hit armor.

== Vorpal Ammunition ($2.5 x mag cost) ==
    
    Vorpal Rounds carry a small nanite payload which damages soft, vital tissue
or circuitry. Unfortunately, the density of nanoweaponry precludes powerful 
locomotive capability. So they only really deal the extra damage if you put the 
round where it's gonna hurt.

    Vorpal rounds deal an extra 10% of normal weapon damage on Critical Hit and
an extra 30% for Extra Critical Hits. For
example, if your gun deals 80 damage normally, and you roll a critical hit when 
using Vorpal rounds, your gun deals 80 + 20 (for Critical) + 8 (Vorpal damage) = 108.
If your roll an Extra Critical Hit, you would deal 80 +  30(for Extra Critical) 
+ 24 (Vorpal Damage) = 134 damage.

== Naphoxic Gel ($1.5 x mag cost) == 
    
    Naphitic gel with small oxygen capsules dispersed inside. Standard flame thrower 
gel requires atmospheric oxygen to burn, and as such cannot be used in a vacuum. 
Naphoxic gel can be burnt in any environment, including space and underwater. 
While in atmospheres with oxygen, it burns hotter than normal gel. The added oxygen
in the tank reduces its overall fuel capacity.
    
    Ammo Capacity: -20% (rounded down)
    Base Damage: +10% (in atmosphere)
