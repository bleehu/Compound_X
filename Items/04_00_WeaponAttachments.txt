Weapon Attachments
==============================
    These add-ons are stat affected items or items that will add functionality 
to a weapon. Most Attachments can be affixed to any weapon unless otherwise 
noted. Ask a GM if you are not sure.

    Please note that unless otherwise specified, only one attachment of a given 
type may be used. For instance, one cannot use two red lasers to get a -4 Miss 
Chance, nor can you use both a reflex sight and a 3.2x scope.

==============================
Slings
==============================

===== Level 1 Requirement =====

== Pistol Lanyard  $100 ==
    If you drop your pistol, it'll fall harmlessly to your leg level instead of 
dropping onto the ground. Holstering your weapon is a free action. Drawing your
pistol takes 1 extra Action next time*.

*If you have 'Quickdraw' and/or 'Pistol Quickdraw' you only need to take 1 
Action to draw instead of 2.

== Two Point Sling $350 ==
    Cannot be used with pistols. You can use your sling to stabilize your grip 
arm. Allows you to carry the gun on your back. 

Range Bracket Miss Chance:
*  -0.5

== One Point Sling $300 ==
    Cannot be used with pistols. Due to the positioning of the weapon, you can 
draw your primary as a free action. Holstering your weapon is a free action.

Strength Requirement:
*  -1

===== Level 5 Requirement =====

== Three Point Smart-Sling $650 ==
    Cannot be used with pistols. Normally thought of as something you would 
cut-off your gun and throw away, the three point smart-sling uses 
electric-textile(TM) to manage the tension and fabric length of your sling. 
This allows three point slings to be used without getting caught on your gear.

    Due to the positioning of the weapon, you can draw your primary as a Free 
Action. Allows you to carry the gun on your back. Holstering your weapon is a 
Free Action.

Strength Requirement:
*  -1

Range Bracket Miss Chance:
*  -0.5

===== Level 10 Requirement =====

== Pistol Smart-Lanyard Holster System  $250 ==
    Dropping your weapon holsters it as free action. Drawing it takes 1 Action 
as normal.

==============================
Ammunition / Magazine Accessories
==============================
    Only extended, magpull, and Drum mags apply to unconventional weapons 
(weapons other than bullet-firing.) Total mag price should be calculated by 
taking multipliers for extended mags first, then multipliers for special effect, 
then magazine accessories like magpulls. Multipliers are multiplied together but 
they do not multiply the constant.

    For example, extended mag + poison bullet magazine magazine cost is 
(1.3x * 2x + 50) = (2.6x+50)

===== Level 1 Requirement =====

== Extended Magazines  $(1.3x) Mag cost. ==
     $12 mags now cost $15, etc. Round Up. Adds 30% magazine capacity to 
magazine/clip-based weapons. Revolver systems or rocket launchers, for example, 
are excluded.

== Hollow Point Magazine  $1.5x + 10 mag cost ==
    +30% base damage, -1 Armor Piercing Level

== Armor Piercing Magazine  $1.5x + 10 mag cost ==
    +1 Armor Piercing Level, -10% base damage

== ED Electric Discharge Magazine  $2x + 20 magazine cost ==
    1/2 the bullet's base damage is converted to electrical damage.

== Overcharge Laser Capacitors $(1.5 x mag cost) ==

    Most common laser weapons have after-market ammunition batteries available
that exceed the recommended voltage for compatibility with that gun. The result
is a weapon system that imparts more damage through a higher intensity laser, at
the cost of running the risk of overheating the emitter manifold and causing the
weapon to "jam." Or in the worst case scenario, to overload even those safety
measures and to cause the weapon to slag, rendering the weapon inoperable and 
potentially physically burning the user. This attachment is only usable with
lasers.

Cost: $1.5 x normal mag
Damage: +15%
Jam Range: + 2 on second roll

== Poison Bullet Magazine  $2x + 50 magazine cost ==
    Your bullet's new damage = 0.9x bullet base damage + stackable poison 
effect based on base bullet damage (before base damage reduction): 
0-60 damage = lesser poison for 2 turns, 61-110 = poison for 2 turns,
111+ = greater poison for 2 turns. Target cannot roll normal saving throws
against the poison.

== RMM Match (Tournament) Grade Ammo  2x mag cost ==
    This high quality ammunition isn't cheap, but it increases the consistency 
of your shots. 

Ranged Miss Chance:
*  -0.5

== High Velocity Ammunition  2.2x mag cost ==
Longest Range Bracket:
*  +10%m or +5m (whichever is higher)

Base Damage:
*  +10% (drop the remainder)

== Magpulls  +$10 per primary magazine, +$5 per secondary magazine ==

    Decrease the Reload DC by 5% for any box magazines. Must be purchased
for each individual magazine. Applies to all weapons that use box magazines.

===== Level 10 Requirement =====

== Drum Mag  $2.5x + 30 mag cost ==
    Increases the capacity of your weapon by a substantial 250% increase. Takes 
up twice the space in your magazine inventory as a standard magazine.

    Only applicable to box-fed automatic weapons [not belt-fed], SMGs, Carbines, 
and shotguns.

== Baffled Ammo ($1.5 x mag cost) ==

    This sabot-discarding ammo has baffled edges so that it barely makes any
noise as it travels through the air. There is no zip or snap noise as bullets
whiz by or into targets. 

    Using Baffled ammo in your weapon reduces the range of your R3 bracket by
10m and reduces the damage of your weapon by 5 damage. Stealth rolls to hide
silent weapons fire automatically succeed. A bullet impact can be heard if a
character is within 5m of the impact, alert and makes an Investigate(PER) check
over DC 50.

== Gluon Rounds ($2.5 x mag cost) ==
    Gluon rounds use a web of inseparable gluon entangled particles to make a
round that won't fragment no matter what it hits. That means that it delivers
all of its energy to one point, which helps penetrate armor even better than
traditional AP rounds. But it also means that it won't break up to damage soft
tissue as effectively. 

    Using gluon rounds adds 1 to your weapon's AP level. Gluon rounds deal 
triple damage to the AS of any armor they hit, but deal 15% less damage to the 
HP of any character they hit.

== Short Circuit Rounds ($1.5 x mag cost) ==
    Short circuit rounds are specifically designed to damage cybernetic targets.
They contain a hyperconductive solute that bonds with most known insulators.
The combination of puncture wounds from the round itself and the chemical 
electric connections from the solute have the nasty effect of routing power and
signals where they least belong. Since the solute has less density than the 
metal that rounds are normally made of, they typically deal less damage to 
biologic targets and armor.

    The net effect is that using Short Circuit rounds lowers the damage dealt
by each shot by 20 points, but if the round hits the health pool of a cybernetic
target, it deals an extra 45 damage.


== Shredder Rounds ($2 x mag cost) ==

    Shredder rounds contain metal fragments which splinter into hyperkinetic
shrapnel upon impact. These fragments spread the energy out upon impact, and
thus are not great against armor, but tear up soft tissue or fragile technology
mercilessly.

    Using Shredder Rounds reduces the APL of your weapon by 1. Deals an 
additional 30% damage as long as your weapon has a higher APL than the target's
armor or if it doesn't hit armor.

== Vorpal Ammunition ($2.5 x mag cost) ==
    
    Vorpal Rounds carry a small nanite payload which damages soft, vital tissue
or circuitry. Unfortunately, the density of nanoweaponry precludes powerful 
locomotive capability. So they only really deal the extra damage if you put the 
round where it's gonna hurt.

    Vorpal rounds deal an extra 10% of normal weapon damage on critical hit and
20% damage on extra-crits. For example, if your gun deals 80 damage normally,
and you roll a crit when using Vorpal rounds, your gun deals 80 + 10 (for crit)
+ 8 (Vorpal damage) = 98. If you scored an extra-crit with the same weapon, 
you'd do 80 + 20 (extra crit damage) + 16 = 116 damage. 

==============================
Total Conversions
==============================
    Total conversions only work with the specified weapon. You may only utilize 
one weapon conversion at a time. HOWEVER, for conversions relying on switching 
out a receiver, you may carry (at max) one additional receiver in order to swap 
kits on the go. You must pass 2 Weapons use / knowledge [Weapons] checks in 
order to successfully convert your weapon on the go. DC 60. Failure on one check 
instantly jams the weapon on first shot. Failure on both checks requires an 
additional check.
