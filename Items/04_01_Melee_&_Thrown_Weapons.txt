==============================
MELEE WEAPONS & UNARMED FIGHTING
==============================

	These weapons/attacks use an 'Accuracy Modifier' instead of
a 'Miss Chance', which is added to your combat dex modifier and
and any relevant feat or skill bonuses to oppose your opponent's 
Guard Class, or GC. Melee weapons do not pierce armor, unless otherwise 
stated.

	Melee weapons come in one of four size categories. The first 
three are Light, One-handed, Two-handed. Characters start 
with proficiency with some number of these based on their class. The 
fifth category is Exotic. Acquiring proficiency with Exotic weapons does 
not grant access to all Exotic weapons, but rather to a particular type, 
such as whips. Exotic proficiencies may rarely be granted by Backgrounds, 
and are more commonly acquired by feat.

	When a Two-handed weapon uses a character's STR mod in its damage 
calculation and the character's STR mod is positive, that character instead 
uses 150% of their STR modifier to calculate damage. For example, if some 
two-handed weapon dealt damage equal to 40 + 2xSTR nod and the character 
wielding it had a STR mod of -4, each strike would deal 32 = 40 + (-4 * 2) 
damage. A character with the same weapon and a STR mod of 12 would deal 
76 = 40 + ((12 * 1.5) * 2) = 40 + (18 * 2) damage per strike.

	Some One-handed weapons have the Hybrid size property. Characters 
with proficiency with Two-handed melee weapons may make two-handed strikes 
with these weapons, which allows them to add their STR modifier as if 
the weapon was Two-handed (see the preceeding paragraph). Such a strike 
must be declared to be two-handed before rolling to hit, and the character 
doing so loses the benefits of any items that require his or her off hand to 
function.*

	Unarmed Strike is not a weapon and therefore does not have a 
size category. All characters are considered proficient with Unarmed 
Strike. Efficacy is an entirely separate issue.

*As an example, a character with a STR mod of 8 is attacking an enemy with a 
hammer of size One-handed - Hybrid that deals 40 + STR mod damage. Before 
rolling the attack, the player may declare that the character is making a 
two-handed strike, which will increase the damage from 40 + 8 = 48 to 
40 + (8 * 1.5) = 40 + 12 = 52. If that character was holding a weapon or 
defensive implement in his or her off-hand, that item cannot be used and 
it provides no bonuses for one round.

==============================
THROWN WEAPONS
==============================

	These weapons work similarly to guns. However your range is determined by 
your DEX or STR and your miss chance is reduced by your [Combat PER Mod]. Like 
melee attacks, if you roll a Crit or 3+ above your Miss Chance, you ignore the 
target's armor and deal full damage. Thrown weapons also benefit from Stealth 
Attacks (see basic rules).

	Thrown weapons benefit from half the base damage bonuses from Unarmed Combat 
feats.

	If you have Weapons - Thrown skill >=20 then all DEX or STR requirements 
for Thrown Weapons are reduced by 1.

	All misc thrown weapons have a Reflex Modifier: -10
	
	Thrown weapons use the same size categories as Melee weapons for 
determining proficiency, though a Two-handed throwing weapon would be 
rare indeed.
