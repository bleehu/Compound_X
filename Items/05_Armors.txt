INTRODUCTION
==============================
	For more information on how Armor functions in CX, please see topic 
"Armor and Getting Hit" in the Basic Rules document.

===== ARMOR SYSTEMS =====
	Armor Systems are composed of an Armor Rig and a protective Armor Material. 
Having lots of armor may slow you down, but armor will prevent you from 
being easy prey. Armor Rigs can be broken down into 4 pieces: helmets,
chest rigs, arm rigs, and leg rigs. 
	Helmets mostly help for RP effects or holding night vision goggles.
The other 3 riggings provide ammunition space and (most rigs) provide
space for installing an Armor Material. Armor Materials must be purchased 
separately than Armor Rigs. Also, Armor systems do not include any protection
without an Armor Material. If you purchase more than one Material* to cover 
your whole body (installing in the Arm, Leg, and Chest Rigs, for example) it 
improves the Armor Coverage (% of Armor protection), but not the quantity of 
the Armor Strength (AS) or the Armor Piercing Level (APL). 
	For example: if you purchase a Chest Rig from the Medium Armor Systems
category and a Standard L1 Material, you'll have 40% coverage, 40 AS, and an 
APL of 1. Now, in addition, if you purchase the Leg Rig from the Medium Armor 
Systems and a Standard L1 Material, you'd have 55% coverage, 40 AS, and an
APL of 1.
		*Note: you cannot mix-and-match Materials or Rig categories. Only one
		kind of Material can be used for the one category of Rigging you are wearing.

===== WHERE IS MY AMMO STORAGE? =====
	If you are wearing any Armor Rigging, you have a certain amount of 
"Mag Space". When you are loading up your guns before a mission, you can decide 
how to arrange your Mag Space to suit your needs. "Mag Space" translates 1 to 1
into Primary Magazines, and 2 to 3 (or 1 to 1) into Secondary Magazines.
	For example, if I have a Chest Rig from the Recon Armor Systems category, I 
would have 5 Mag Space. I can turn that Mag Space into 3 Primary Magazine and 3
Secondary Magazine spaces, 5 Primary Magazine spaces, or any feasible combination. 

===== WHAT IS AN 'ADVANCED RIG'? =====
	Advanced (adv.) Rigs typically provide less Armor Coverage and Mag Space 
than their regular counterparts, but they allow you to attach Shield Generators,
Hard Point Equipment, and/or Cloaking Equipment. Advanced Rigs allow you to do
this by providing 'Hard Points'. Hard Points are special joints and fittings that
make it easy to attach equipment. When you purchase equipment, it will list how
many Hard Points it consumes. You can't attach more equipment than you have available
Hard Points.
	Hard Point Equipment/Shields/Cloaking often come in two sizes, "Primary Modules" and 
"Secondary Modules". After you purchase and install a Primary Module, you can also purchase
and install a Secondary Module(s) that augment the benefits of the Primary Module. The 
benefits are listed in the description of a given module. They do not mix and match;
Secondary Modules only work for the Primary Module they are designed for.
	Some modules have a "____ Skill Requirement". In order to operate the module, you
must have the required quantity of the given skill.

==============================
ARMOR RIGS
==============================
	Armor rigs cannot be worn in combination with other Rigs from different types, tactical 
vests, or EVA suits (for example: Recon Rigs can't be worn with Light Rigs). Some of the 
lighter Armor Rigs cannot hold Armor Materials, designated by "(*No Armor*)". Those rigs 
only provide more Mag Space or more Hard Points; they don't provide additional Armor Coverage.

==============================
EVA SUITS AND FLIGHT HELMETS
==============================
	Helmets may be worn with or added to Armor or Environment (EVA) suits.
EVA suits are air- and water-tight when combined with an EVA or flight helmet.
EVA suits are bulky and cannot be used with Armor Rigs, also, DEX skill checks
have a -10% penalty and movement is reduced in RP. If the suit is hit more 
times than its "Suit Integrity" rating, it will no longer be able to maintain
air pressure (player health has to be damaged in order for "Suit Integrity" to
count a hit). Suits traditionally come in white, yellow or red.

=====   LEVEL 1 REQUIREMENT   =====
	
Basic Tactical Helmet
Cost:	$100
	Tactical and Combat helmets can hold NVGs, lights, radios, etc.
Protects the head from blunt trauma (mostly RP effects).

Basic Flight Helmet
Cost:	$240
	A simple flight helmet. does not provide full seal, but can be paired with 
air- and space-craft external oxygen systems. Protects the head from blunt
trauma (mostly RP effects).

Environment Helmet
Cost:	$350
	Provides a full environmental seal. Protects the head from blunt 
trauma (mostly RP effects).
	
Basic Flight-Suit
Cost:	$800
Suit integrity: 5 shots
	Basic Environment Suit, offers minimal ballistic protection. When shot, 
the suit will decompress or compress as necessary to maintain air pressure.

Armor material separately (purchase a single Armor Material at Chest Armor cost).

=====   LEVEL 5 REQUIREMENT   =====
	
Polymer-Alloy Environment Suit
Cost:	$1200
	Holds 1 trauma (Armor Material) plate in the front and back. 30% coverage, must

==============================
STANDARD BALLISTIC ARMOR MATERIALS
==============================
	Adding any Armor Materials to a Chest, Leg, or Arm Rig adds to your 
movement speed penalties by -1m per Material added. The secondary stat,
"Carry Strength", cancels out movement speed penalties; for more information,
see section "Player Stats," in the Basic Rules document.
