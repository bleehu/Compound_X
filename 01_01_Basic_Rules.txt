==============================
Premise
==============================

	Welcome to Compound X! The specific time and place that your adventure takes
place is up to your Game Master (often called a GM for short), but all of them
take place far in the future where humans have left earth on their faster-than-light
spaceships to explore dangerous new worlds fraught with friend and foe of all
manner of robots and aliens! 

	Will you be the dashing hero? Or perhaps the evil villain plotting galactic 
domination? Or maybe a mercenary who's somewhere in between? The choice is
yours and your legend will be told as you play the game!
 
==============================
The Primary Game Mechanic
==============================

	You may now be thinking to yourself; "Self-person, we sure can't wait to go
gallivanting through the galaxy doing fantastic things and seeing the beautiful
galaxies! But how would we do that?" Well, yourself doesn't have the answer yet,
but good news! You just found it!

	In Compound X, most things you will do will be accompanied by a 'roll'. That 
translates to rolling the dice. Rolling the dice is our way of factoring in
the human (or not human) tendency to do things in a way which isn't perfect.
When you roll high, you do very well. When you roll low, you goof up. But hold 
your horses, or kangaroo or what have you. This is a strategy RPG, not a gambling game.
Each roll will have numbers which you will add to or subtract from the one you 
get from the dice. This represents how good or bad your particular character is
at doing whatever it is you are attempting to do. What to add when is discussed
in detail below. 

	For now, know that Compound X uses two ten-sided dice (usually called D10s) to
represent a d100, a percent. One of the D10s represents the number in the 10's place.
the other represents the number in the 1's place. Most dice sets come with two
D10s, one with a zero after the number on the face, the other without that zero.
In that case, obviously you add the numbers on the face of the dice together to
find out what you rolled. If your dice came from different sets, you must pick
which dice represents the tens place before you roll. i.e. if one die rolls a
40 and the other rolls a 6, you rolled 46%. Alternatively, if you have an orange
die which represents your ten's place and a purple die which represents your one's
place, and you roll an orange 3 and a purple 9 then you rolled 39%.

	It's important to note that you don't have to roll for everything. Your 
character probably knows how to do mundane things like brush their teeth, open 
an unlocked door, and tie their shoes. It's okay to just do these things, even 
in combat.

Rolling with Advantage:
	Sometimes circumstances or the occasional feat may prompt you to make a roll 
with Advantage or Disadvantage. In such cases you make the roll twice. With 
Advantage you take the better roll, while with Disadvantage you take the worse 
roll. Advantage and Disadvantage do not stack with themselves. If you would have 
both Advantage and Disadvantage on the same roll, then they cancel each other, 
and you just roll once.

Rolling the Average:
	There are certain circumstances and feats which allow for Rolling the Average.
This must be announced before the die are cast. Critical fails or Critical successes
are ignored when Rolling the Average. To do this, roll percentile dice twice, add
the two numbers together, and divide by 2. The resulting number is your roll. 

==============================
Role Playing and Combat
==============================

	Compound X has two main 'modes' if you will: Combat, and Not in Combat. 
While in combat, the rules are a little more specific so as to support strategy 
and planning. During combat, each player takes their turn in a particular order, 
and while you can still make up what you want to do, most actions fall into 
pre-existing categories that take a specific amount of time and typically do a 
specified amount of damage. More detail on that in the "Combat" section of Basic 
Rules.

	Out of combat, turns are a little more fluid. Usually players take their turn 
describing what they want to do when each player gets an idea of what to do. If 
two players have an idea at the same time, please be courteous and take turns. 
It's much easier for the GM to listen to one player at a time. In addition to 
taking turns, please also be polite and share the spotlight. You ALL are the 
main heroes or villains of this story. Make sure everyone gets a chance to do 
the one-liner they want, or to have their moment of glory.

	Either in combat or out, play usually follows this loop:

1.	The GM describes the environment and the situation. Usually the DM will ask "What do you want to do?"
2.	The player describes what they want to do
3. 	The GM checks if that's even a possible thing that can be done. (skip this step if that's obvious)
4.	The GM says what kind of roll is needed to see if the player succeeds, if any roll is necessary.
5.	The player rolls the dice and adds the numbers as described below.
6. 	The GM checks the total against the DC and narrates what happens*
7.	Then the next player begins their turn.

*The DC stands for "the Difficulty Challenge", a number that
typically only the GM knows which represents how hard a typical task
is. Then the GM narrates how the action goes depending on if the 
player succeeds or fails and by how much.

==============================
Your Character
==============================

	In Compound X, you control one particular person. This person is your avatar
in the game world. You decide what they say, how they react and what they do
just by telling your Game Master at the appropriate time. But before you can
jump right in and start playing, you need to create a character! This is often
one of the most fun parts of the game!

	Making a character is a slightly involved process that can take a new player 
up to two hours to fully flesh out. There are several parts of characters which
are detailed below, but let's list them here briefly before we get into the 
nitty-gritty of it.

	If you want some extra guidance after reading through the sections below, 
see the 00_New_Player_Walkthrough.txt document in CharacterCreation. Following 
its steps will give you a customized, relatively low-complexity character that 
will help you learn to play the rest of Compound X.

Base Stats:
	These decide what raw characteristics make up your character, and are 
factored into most other decisions you make both in game and for the rest of 
character creation. Choosing your stats is a very good way to start making a 
character.

Species/Race:
	Is your character a robot? What about a human? Or maybe the catlike aliens 
known as Tundari? Different species and races get small bonuses to different 
aspects of combat and are liked or disliked by different people in the galaxy 
accordingly.

Class: 
	Think of this like your job. Are you a sniper, waiting for the perfect shot? 
Or are you a pilot who can thread a needle with your starfighter? Or maybe 
you're a veteran soldier, who's seen it all. Classes define what armor and 
weapons your character can use in combat, as well as certain special abilities 
which might help solve puzzles or get you better discounts at stores. Your class 
also determines how much money you start with to buy equipment and how many 
Nanites you can use at once.

Nanites:
	The evolution of technology brought about the ability to design and control 
microscopic machines. Such a powerful advancement assists in all forms of life 
in the Compound X universe. Nanites are used to activate powerful abilities such 
as sprinting extremely fast, aiming incredibly well, infusing bullets with 
electrical energy, and more.

Skills: 
	Each character learns things while going through life. Maybe your time in 
the military taught you how to navigate using the stars or maybe your time 
working at a mechanic's shop made you good at repairing things? Or maybe you're 
one of those people who is just naturally good at hacking computers. Picking 
these numbers will represent that in the game world.

Equipment:
	Your equipment is made up of your character's weapon, armor and 
miscellaneous items. You'll get money to buy them with at the start of the game 
and you'll earn more money as you go about your adventures.

Feats: 
	Your character will gain special perks as you level up. This could range 
from reloading really fast, to having more health to being able to do a fast 
combat roll under fire. Tackle these when your character advances to level 3.

==============================
Base Stats
==============================

	Each player has what are called Base Stats. An average person has a '5' for
each stat, but an average player has a '6'. Base Stats are split into Primary
and Secondary stats. Primary stats are determined by your Base Stat points.
Secondary stats are derived from primary stats. The largest primary stat
associated with a given secondary stat determines the secondary stat's value; 
However, if you have a primary stat that is associated with more than one 
secondary stat, you may have to choose which secondary stat to contribute to.
These stats are as follows (secondary stat associations are indented):

Strength:
* Carry Ability
* Movement Speed
Perception:
* None
Fortitude:
* Carry Ability
Charisma:
* Skill Point Gain
Intelligence:
* Skill Point Gain
Dexterity:
* Movement Speed
Luck:
* None

Secondary Stat Assignment Examples: 
	Charisma and Intelligence are associated with Skill Point Gain. If you have 
5 Charisma and 6 Intelligence, you would have 6 Skill Point Gain.

	Let's now assume you have 6 Strength, 3 Dexterity, and 4 Fortitude. You would 
have 3 Movement Speed (from your Dexterity) and 4 Carry Ability (from your Fortitude). 
Now, Strength is much higher than both of those, but Strength can't determine both 
Movement Speed and Carry Ability so you have to decide whether you want:

* 3 Movement Speed and 6 Carry Ability, or 
* 6 Movement Speed and 4 Carry Ability 

	Strength determining Movement Speed is likely to be the better choice, as 
Carry Ability doesn't contribute as much to your character (see Secondary Stat 
Details, below)and you have a total of 6 + 4 = 10 points in secondary stats 
instead of 3 + 6 = 9. 

	Usually you can tell a lot about a character just by their base stats. For 
instance, a character with 9 strength and 3 intelligence is usually either a 
brutish bully or a tough but lovable teddy bear of a person. Where a character 
with 10 intelligence and 2 charisma is probably a brilliant nerd who might be 
shy or just have a terrible stutter.

	But your raw base stat is rarely used in calculations during the game. To
get the math to work out better, we usually us what is called a 'Stat Bonus'.
Stat bonuses are used very often. They are calculated by one of the two equivalent 
equations below (use whichever looks easier to you):

* Stat Bonus = (4 * Stat) - 20 
* Stat Bonus = (Stat - 5) * 4

	For instance, if you were trying to lift something heavy, your GM may tell 
you to roll a 'Strength Check' and add your 'Strength Bonus'. To do this, you 
would roll two 10-sided dice as explained in the Primary Game Mechanic above, 
and add your Strength Bonus to that. Let's say that you rolled a 71, and your 
Strength Base Stat is a very beefy 8. Then your Strength bonus would be:

	(8 - 5) * 4 = 3 * 4 = 12

	and the score of your roll would be 

	71 + 12 = 83

	That's a really high roll! But that may or may not be enough to lift the 
object depending on how heavy it is!

===== Combat Stat Bonus for Ranged and Melee Accuracy =====

	These bonuses use a table instead of the above Stat Bonus equation, as 
combat accuracy rolls are played out on a d10, not a d100 scale. The two 
most-used base stats for accuracy rolls are Perception and Dexterity. The 
Perception stat affects a ranged weapon's range bracket miss chance, and the 
Dexterity stat affects melee miss chance.

== COMBAT MISS CHANCE BONUSES TABLE ==

+--------+-------------+
| Stat   | Stat Bonus  |
+--------+-------------+		
| 1      | -1.5	       |
+--------+-------------+
| 2      | -1	       |
+--------+-------------+
| 3-4    | -0.5	       |
+--------+-------------+	
| 5      |  0	       |	
+--------+-------------+	
| 6-7    |  0.5	       |	
+--------+-------------+	
| 8-9    |  1	       |	
+--------+-------------+	
| 10-11  |  1.5	       |	
+--------+-------------+	
| 12-13  |  2	       |	
+--------+-------------+	
| 14     |  2.5	       |		
+--------+-------------+
| 15     |  3	       |		
+--------+-------------+

	Drop any remaining decimal (0.5 or -0.5 becomes 0) -in other words- only use 
integers when you are writing down the final miss chances of your weapon(s). For 
example, let's say you have a basic SMG with miss chance brackets of 4, 5, and 6. 
Assuming you have 6 Perception,your PER bonus is 0.5 and thus, your gun's range 
miss chance brackets are:

	(4 - 0.5), (5 - 0.5), (6 - 0.5)  =  3.5, 4.5, 5.5

	If these are your final miss chances, you would have to drop the remainder 
and your slightly-above-average perception wouldn't make enough of a difference 
to affect your miss chances!

	But let's say you also have a Dot Sight that you can put on your SMG. The 
Dot Sight gives a bonus -0.5 range bracket miss chance (among other benefits). 
This means you now have the following range brackets:

	(4 - 0.5 - 0.5), (5 - 0.5 - 0.5), (6 - 0.5 - 0.5)  =  3, 4, 5

	Perfect! Now your Perception and Dot Sight bonuses, together, reduce your 
range bracket miss chances by 1 point. If you don't have any other bonuses (from 
other attachments, feats, or abilities) then you would write down 3, 4, 5 as 
your range bracket miss chances.

	If your gun has automatic and/or burst fire, you'd add its associated miss 
chances to your range bracket miss chances and separately write down those 
numbers (after all bonuses to range bracket miss chance and bonuses to automatic 
or burst fire). In other words, if you have a ranged weapon with semi-auto, 
burst, and automatic fire modes, then you should write down 3 sets of 3 miss
chances; one set for each of the 3 fire modes. For example, let's now assume 
your gun has a burst fire miss chance of 1 and an automatic fire miss
chance of 3, your ranged bracket miss chances should look something like this...

0-10m, 11-20m, 21-40m	range brackets
  3,     4,      5    	semi-auto miss chances
  4,     5,      6	burst fire miss chances
  6,     7,      8	automatic fire miss chances

===== Primary Stat Details =====	

Strength (STR):
	How strong are you? This stat determines how big of a gun you can carry and
how hard you can punch or hit with strength melee weapons. It might also allow 
you to solve puzzles with the brute force approach.

	If you have 1 Strength, you are exceptionally weak and your max movement per
2 actions is 2m (unless your Dex is 1) and you cannot wear armor that offers more 
than 50% coverage.

Perception (PER): 
	Your ability to see, hear, smell and sense the world around you, as well as
to interpret what those sensations indicate. Perception affects your weapon 
accuracy and ability to cut through the chaos of battle to stay oriented. A high
perception makes you harder to sneak up on. 

	If you have 1 Perception, you are partially blind, only have 1 eye, or
something similar. You cannot use the Search or Awareness skills and you have a 
-20 malus to Speech skill rolls. 

Fortitude (FORT): 
	How tough are you? Fortitude determines your maximum health, how hard you 
are to knock off of your feet, and contributes to your saving throws.

	Your Maximum Health = 50 + 10 * FORT

	If you have 1 Fortitude, you are exceptionally frail. You can't inflict lethal 
unarmed damage and your unarmed damage is halved. Also, when you deal melee damage, 
you inflict half of the damage on yourself.

Charisma (CHA): 
	How good are you at communicating with those around you? Charisma affects a 
number of interpersonal skills like haggling and diplomacy. It also contributes 
to how hard it is to dominate your will.

	If you have 1 Charisma, you have a debilitating speech impediment. You have
an additional malus of -24 when using Speech, Deceive, and etc. skill. Under 
normal circumstances, you have to succeed a DC 30 CHA skill check in order to 
communicate with a non-player character (NPC). In combat, vocal communication to 
anything costs 1 Action.

	If you have 6 or more Charisma you gain the feat "Will to Survive". The feat 
scales depending on how many points you have in Charisma. Or, if you have 9 or 
more Charisma, you get to choose between taking feat "Will to Survive" or feat 
"Positional Mastermind". 

Intelligence (INT): 
	How smart are you? Intelligence determines how quickly you acquire new 
skills when you level up and how proficient you are at using some of those 
skills.

	If you have 1 Intelligence, let's just say, you aren't particularly smart. 
You cannot attempt to use any skill that you do not have Proficiency in (see the 
"RP / Using Skills" section).

	If you have 9 or more Intelligence you are exceptionally gifted and gain 
additional feats at certain levels; for more information, please see the 
"LEVELING-UP TABLE" below.

Dexterity (DEX): 
	How nimble are you? Dexterity determines your maximum move speed in combat, 
as well as how much damage you do with finesse melee weapons like knives. 
Dexterity also contributes to skill checks for doing things with a character's 
body like climbing, jumping, or dancing.

	If you have 1 Dexterity, you are especially clumsy or suffer from a 
debilitating illness which affects your ability to move swiftly and precisely. 
You cannot learn any skills that use Dexterity as the contributing stat (for 
example, lockpicking).

Luck (LUCK): 
	Some people are just lucky! A GM will often have you roll luck to see if a 
door was left unlocked or if you just happened to duck to pick up a coin off the 
ground right when an assassin is trying to shoot you in the head. Luck also has 
a significant effect on what loot you find in dungeons and your chance to roll a 
critical hit.

	If you have 6 Luck or more, you gain feat "Lucky". The feat scales depending
on how many points you have in Luck.	

	If you have 1 Luck, it goes without saying, you are very unlucky. At the 
start of a combat encounter, roll a d10 and receive a penalty from the Black Cat 
table, below.		

===== BLACK CAT TABLE =====	
+-------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Roll  | Effect                                                                                | 
+-------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1-2   | Your primary weapon malfunctions/breaks and you cannot use it until DC 60 repaired    |

| 3-4   | You cannot critically hit or critically succeed (in any form) in this encounter       |
+-------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 5-6   | You trip and hurt yourself, take 15 damage and lose three actions from your 1st turn  |
+-------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 7-8   | Mental breakdown, roll DC 75 Will save or gain status effect 'Fear' of enemies        |

+-------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


===== Secondary Stat Details =====

Movement Speed:
	Your speed in meters, for every two actions. Use (Movement Speed)/2 for one 
action (drop the remainder). For more information, see topic "Movement and 
Sprinting", below.

Carry Ability:
	Cancels out movement speed penalties. Carry Ability allows you to carry 
heavier weapons or heavier armor without slowing you down. If you have 6 Carry 
Ability and 6m of movement speed penalties, you end up with no movement speed 
penalties.

Skill Point Gain:
	How many skill points you gain every level. Every time you level up, you 
gain skill points according to your "Skill Point Gain". Note about gaining skill 
points: you have a max of 50 points in any one Skill. Also, you have a max of 
17+3*[CHA] points in any one Charisma Skill.

===== Nanites =====

	Although not a primary or secondary stat per se, The maximum number of 
Nanites you can use at a given time is determined by your character class and an 
associated primary stat. Your class may tell you its "Class Primary Attribute" 
is Strength. In that case, Strength * 10 is your maximum Nanites. 

More generally:
	Your Maximum Nanites = (Your Class's Primary Attribute) * 10
Some class feats and other abilities can increase the number of Nanites you can 
hold and use at a given time. Also, Unlike Health, Nanites regenerate during 
combat at a rate of 3 Nanites per turn. 
	

===== Assigning Stats to a New Character =====

	When making a new character, you'll have to assign their Base stats.
This will tell you a lot about your character. When assigning your stats,
no stat can be higher than a 9 before applying racial/species bonuses and
no stat can be lower than a 1 after applying racial/species bonuses. 

	Additionally, even after race/species bonuses, feats, equipment, and base stat 
bonuses from leveling, no stat can ever be over 15 until your character is 
level 15. After level 15, the limit for stat points is 20. The number of 
initial base stat points that you have to apply is listed with your Race or 
Species. See chapter 1: Races if you haven't yet. 

===== Assigning A Class to your Character =====

	Most Characters start at level 1 so the Player will choose a Class for that 
Character at that time. A Character will only ever have one Class at a time, and
under normal circumstances, cannot change their class once it is picked. 

	On occasion (especially for new Players), a character may start at level 0 
with no Class. This is usually for a tutorial mission and a Class is selected
when the Character has completed the tutorial and leveled up to level 1. 

===== Weapon Proficiencies =====

	Each Class comes with a specific list of Weapon Proficiencies. If your 
Character has a proficiency with a type of weapon, then they can use that weapon
in combat and can purchase weapons of that type in the world or during character
creation. If your Character lacks proficiency with a weapon, then they can't 
purchase or use a weapon of that type. 

	Note that Weapon Proficiency is different than having Skills with that 
weapon. For more on Skills, see the "RP / Using Skills" section of this document.

===== Armor Proficiencies =====

	Just like each Class comes with a set of Weapon Proficiencies, it also comes
with a list of Armor Proficiencies. Just like Weapon Proficiencies, if your 
class has a Proficiency with a given armor type then they can purchase or wear
that armor type in combat. If your character doesn't have that proficiency, then
they can't.

==============================
Leveling Up
==============================

	When you level up, gain feats according to the table below. With 
Intelligence 9 or higher, receive more feats. The feats listed in the table are 
totals, not to be added together. Every 5th level, +1 Class feat.

	Every level, gain 2*(Skill Point Gain) skill points.

	On levels 5, 9, 15 and 20, gain a stat point. The stat increase happens 
before any calculations, so if you had 10 int, and increased to 11, you would 
get 22 skill points for the level. Additionally, any stat point alteration 
forces a recalculation on all affected values.

==============================
Saving Throws
==============================

	Saving throws are used in dire or critical situations to defend against very 
negative effects.

- Will: defend against a mind affect (Ex: throw off hopelessness after crashing in an escape pod)
- Shock: maintain composure after serious damage (Ex: stay conscious after being shot by a high caliber round)
- Reflex: quickly react to an event (Ex: dodge falling debris, fire at an enemy if they leap from one piece of cover to another).

The equations are as follows:

- Will: 2*(Cha + Int - 6) Rational: Normally wisdom would be applied, so Will in Compound X is descried as your internal voice motivating you to endure a mental hardship.
- Shock: 2*(Fort + Int - 6) Rational: You need to recognize that you are in shock, and resist its physical effects.
- Reflex: 2*(Per + Dex - 6) Rational: In order to react quickly to an event you need to be able to see it coming.

==============================
Medicine Saving Throws
==============================

	Ouch! you've just been shot! You'd better call for a medic or apply a med 
kit before you bleed out! "But how do I use a med kit? Or if I'm a medic, how do
I stabilize and heal an ally?" I''m glad you asked. The rules are as follows:
The medicine DC is equal to the damage dealt. On a fail skill check, no healing 
occurs. On a success, heal an amount equal to Medic skill + DC surplus.

	For example, a Player Character is dealt 70 damage. Their medic has 25 skill 
in medicine. Medic rolls an 86 (after adding the medic skill), so they heal 
25+(86-70) for 41 health healed.

	Individual wounds are healed individually. 3x 20-damage wounds need three 
rolls of 21 or higher before they are fully healed.

	For examble, a Player Character takes 70 damage. Medic has 25 skill. Medic 
rolls an 86 (with medic skill), so they heal 25+(86-70) for 41 health. Now the 
Character still has a 29 damage deficit (70-41), so the medic would need to roll 
over a DC of 29 to heal the remaining 29 damage. (The Medic Cannot overheal a 
wound).

	Medics need not use a medic-kit so long as the have their medicine bag (or 
equivalent) on their person. If they do not have their medicine bag with them 
when they are trying to heal a teammate, they can make the attempt at a +20 DC.

Using a medikit:

	Medic-kit, non-medic user: works as if you are a medic with skill 30.

	Medic-kit, medic user: Works as normal, but add 30 to amount healed.

==============================
Death, Dying, and Downed
==============================

	Oh no! You have less than 1 health point left! What now!?! The good news is 
you are not* dead yet. But you are doing what's known as "bleeding out". The 
first time your character falls below 1 hit point, you get 3 saving throws 
called Death Saving Throws (or 'DSTs' for short). You roll one saving throw per 
turn that you are downed and these DSTs are not modified by any attribute. If you 
succeed a DST, (see 'Downed', below) you continue bleeding out; however, you get 
to roll again next turn. If you fail 3 DSTs, you die. Once you fail a DST, the 
next time you fall below 1 health point you only get 2 DSTs (2 failed throws and 
you die). If you failed a DST during the first two times you were downed and 
you are downed a third time, you only get 1 DST. You regain a DST by going a 
whole encounter without failing a DST. You can have a maximum of 3 saving throws 
at any one time.

Downed:
	The state of having less than one Health Point is called being "downed." It 
is also sometimes called "bleeding out." They are equivalent. While a character 
is downed, they cannot move, cannot stand under their own power, and fall prone 
if not supported by other means. They cannot speak, but can mumble 
incomprehensibly.

	Every turn that a character takes while they are downed, they must make a 
Death Saving Throw of DC 50. Success and failure of these throws is detailed 
above. Even if you had 5 health and took 80 damage, when you go down you go to 0
health. Any additional attacks you sustain will push you into negative health. 

Stabilize:
	As an action, a teammate may bring you back up to 1 health point by succeeding 
on a Medicine skill check to stabilize you. Once stabilized, you may take actions 
and speak as normal. Don't forget that a recently stabilized character may need 
to take an action to retrieve a dropped weapon and/or take an action to stand 
back up if you have fallen.

	The skill DC to stabilize a fallen comrade is 80. Medicine skill, INT mod, 
and any bonuses from medical equipment such as medpacks may be added to that roll. 

*Some hazards can reduce you to zero health points and kill you 
instantly. Some examples are falling several stories, lava baptisms,
or having a space station dropped on you. Do not do these things. They are
also known to the state of California to cause cancer. 

==============================
Resting
==============================

Short Rest:
	Taking about an hour, characters can take a Short Rest to rest and recoup 
which will restore all the character's Nanites.

Long Rest:
	Taking about eight hours, characters need to rest after a long day of 
adventuring. If you choose to stay up all night, you won't be at your best for 
the next day. Restores all of a character's Nanites.

==============================
RP / Using Skills
==============================

	The GM may ask you to roll a certain skill to see if your character can do 
something. This may be something like, "Roll Awareness to see if you spot the 
truck barreling towards you," or it might look like, "Roll Medicine to see if 
you can patch up the gaping wound in your chest spewing blood." Anytime you 
need to Pass a Skill check, there will be a DC (Difficulty Check) you have to 
exceed in order to successfully pass the check. Again: YOU MUST ROLL *OVER* A DC 
TO SUCCEED IN A SKILL CHECK. the DC does not need to be given out by the GM, but if
a DC seems too high, you have the right to grumble (but seriously, ask your GM if 
something seems too difficult. There is usually a reason why tying your shoe 
takes a DC of 70% on that particular day, etc). After you have rolled, please
apply any and all relevant skills to your result. If you are rolling to silently
take down an opponent, the GM can either have you roll a stealth check and an 
unarmed combat check, or double the DC, and have you roll once adding both 
modifiers. Also add any relevant Stat Bonuses to a roll. When rolling 
awareness, add your PER Bonus, etc.

	At any time out of combat, you may decide to use one of your skills. If you 
are not pressured by imminent / immediate danger, you may "take a 100%" to pass 
a skill check, then apply any ranks in the skill. When rushed by a time 
constraint or danger, you can "take a 50%" to pass a skill check, then apply any 
ranks in said skill. However, some checks cannot be passed in this way. If you 
are staring at a ship''s blast doors, and want to kick them down, you can't take
additional time to increase your odds of success.

	If you want to use a skill in combat, see the "Combat: Actions" subsection.
Skill ranks are exact percentiles to pass a skill check. If you have 50 ranks 
in a skill, then you have a +50% chance to pass a skill check for that skill. 
Every time you purchase a new skill for 10 Skill points, it starts as a +10% 
skill. When leveling up you may add up to 10 points to any one skill.

	Normally a character can attempt any skill check whether or not they have 
invested in learning the skill; however, sometimes a character will have more 
penalties if they attempt to use a skill that they don't have "Proficiency" in. 
A character has Proficiency in a skill when they have 10 or more skill points in 
that skill.

	Defenders win ties for opposing rolls. If a character ties a DC they fail.

==============================
Player Weapon Customization
==============================

	Weapon customization can be done anytime you are in a town, space station, or 
other mercantile area. Ask the GM if there are weapon shops or kiosks around, 
they should point you to one. From there you can apply upgrades and attachments.

	The GM may tell you specific attachments that are available, or they may say 
you can just go about your usual customization. See the Attachments document
for more details on the kinds of attachments you can use, and their restrictions.

==============================
Combat
==============================

	Combat starts when either you or an enemy decides they would like to make an 
attack. Each "Player turn" lasts 4-6 seconds, and consists of 4 "Actions" 
(described below).

===== Miss Chance Limits =====

	At any time when using a melee or ranged weapon, you have a minimum of -2 
weapon miss chance, and a minimum of 1 Auto or Burst miss chance (if relevant). 
These minimums apply after all PER/DEX/STR/Attachment modifiers, at all ranges, 
and before cover and any other environmental effects. Using an ability could 
push you below the minimum miss chance.

===== Melee Combat =====

	A character occupies 1m of space. however, as Compound X is not played out 
on a squares-board, usually it doesn't matter if two players are within the same 
1m space.

	Two Players locked in melee combat are considered to be in adjacent 1m spaces, 
not in the same 1m space. Have you ever seen a fight? you don't start face-to-face 
unless you're at a bar.

	Generally speaking, once a character has initiated melee combat with another 
opponent, they are both considered to be in "melee combat," and occupy spaces 
within reach of one of the combatant's melee weapons. At this point (unless one 
character has a CQB weapon) both characters are assumed to be using their fists 
or other melee weapons. If a character wishes to leave melee combat, they incur 
an "Opportunity Attack."  
	
Opportunity Attack:
	A free attack* that is triggered when an opponent leaves melee combat or 
walks adjacent (within melee range) to a character that is aware of their 
opponent. Characters also incur Opportunity Attacks by performing a non-combat 
skill check when locked in melee combat (such as trying to repair their own 
armor) or by trying to shoot a different opponent with a non-CQB weapon.

*The free attack can be made with a CQB weapon or a melee weapon (depending on 
if the weapon is already equipped in the character's hands). If the free attack 
is made with a CQB weapon, and the weapon is not already aimed at the target, 
standard Hip Firing rules apply.

Making Melee Attacks:
	Melee combat is relatively simple. To hit an enemy player: add your 
dexterity combat modifier to a d10 roll plus your combat modifier from your 
weapon/attack*, and add any relevant skill(s)**. The result must be greater than 
the opponent's Guard DC: 

	(DEX * 4)/10 + any skill** in combat. 

	Drop any decimal remainder. If you successfully hit your opponent, you roll 
armor as normal (for more details, see below sections "Armor and Getting Hit" 
and "Damage Types and Armor Types"). Your damage dealt is often based on a 
combination of your DEX and STR. If you are wielding a weapon against an unarmed 
opponent, they may still incur damage depending on their skill.

	NOTE: if you are fighting unarmed, you can (normally) deal full non-lethal 
damage or half lethal damage (your choice). Non-lethal damage should be recorded 
as a separate (duplicate) health bar. When their non-lethal health bar reaches 0, 
the target becomes unconscious/incapacitated.

*Modifiers from specific weapons or unarmed[x] attacks are listed in the weapons 
document.

**To determine bonus modifiers from skill, for every 5 skill points in a relevant 
skill (such as "melee combat skill") take a bonus +0.5 when rolling against guard 
DC. Drop any decimal remainder after adding all the modifiers.

Hitting What You Intend:
	If you roll 3+ above your miss chance (3+ above the opponent's guard DC), 
you ignore the opponent's armor and deal full damage. 

Grappling:
	A character may grapple another character when they are both in melee 
distance. Doing so provides the grappled player an Opportunity Attack on the 
grappling player. During grappling, both sides roll opposing grapple checks to 
see who maintains control. Once you have control you may make a grapple check 
to subdue your opponent (by choke-out, pin, or a joint lock). You may also strike
an opponent during grappling, but if the strike fails your opponent may attempt 
to gain control of the grapple. Skill in grappling is different than skill in 
unarmed combat.

Kicking/Shoving:
	Instead of dealing full damage, a character can try to kick/shove a human sized
opponent to force movement by rolling for a normal unarmed/armed melee attack 
with an additional -2 miss penalty against the opponent's Guard DC. If the attack 
succeeds, it yields 1/2 the damage it normally would and pushes the target up to
1m for every 5 strength you have.

===== Actions =====

	During combat, your character has 4 Actions. Actions are used for fighting, 
movement, items, whimpering, etc. Here is a list of common tasks and their
relative cost:

Reloading a Pump-Action Shotgun: 4 Actions
Reloading a Bolt-Action Weapon: 3 Actions
Reloading a Magazine Fed Weapon: 2 Actions
Moving DEX # of Meters: 2 Actions
Hunkering Down: 1 Action
Firing a Semi-Auto Gun: 1 Action
Suppressing an Area/Target: 1 Action
Cast a Spell: 1 Action
Aiming Down Gun Sights: 1 Action
Turning on a Flashlight: 1 Action
Unholstering Pistol or Grabbing a Weapon/Item: 1 Action
Performing a Skill Check (other than Getting Bearings/Awareness of surroundings): 1 Action
Conversing With Partners: Free Action
Getting Your Bearings / Non Skill-Based Perception: Free Action

===== Reactions & Held Actions =====

	Certain abilities or circumstances will allow you to take a special action 
in response to a triggering event. A reaction occurs at the immediate moment 
that it is triggered, whether it is your turn or not. The most common reaction 
you will encounter will be from Suppression (described in "Ranged Combat", 
below) or Opportunity Attacks (described in "Melee Combat", above). After the 
reaction occurs, play continues as normal (if it is an opponents turn, they 
continue their turn). 

Held Actions:
	A type of reaction. A player may choose to forgo using up to 2 actions at 
the end of their turn. The player must declare to their DM what those actions 
are to be triggered by then play continues as normal. If the trigger occurs 
before the player's next turn, the player gets to immediately use their 1 or 2 
actions. If the trigger does not occur before the player's turn, they lose their
held action(s) and start their turn as normal. 

	For example, let's say my Character and his/her friends are walking along a 
ledge. I know that one of the Characters in the party is clumsy so I have my 
Character move along the ledge, and I ask the DM if I can save my last action to 
try and catch the clumsy Character, should they trip. The DM approves my plan 
and play continues. On the clumsy Character's turn, they start to scoot across
the ledge and trip! As soon as they trip, my held action triggers and my 
Character saves them from falling off the ledge and their turn continues. If 
they had not tripped, my held action would've been lost at the start of my 
following turn.

===== Movement and Sprinting =====

	You can run 'Movement Speed' minus 'Movement Speed Penalty' number of meters 
for every 2 actions spent (Movement Speed Penalties should be rounded up before 
the subtraction). A character with 1 Movement Speed and 0 move speed penalties 
can move 1m per 2 actions, or 2m per 4 actions (a full turn). You can sprint 
instead of running, for a +1 movement bonus per action. However, firing your 
weapon after doing so will cause you to incur a +1 miss chance penalty. The 
penalty occurs during the actions you sprint, as well as 2 actions afterwards. 
You can sprint for a number of subsequent Actions equal to your Fortitude. You 
can jump horizontally Dex/2 meters, and add 1m if you have a 3m running start.
You can jump vertically Str/3 meters.


===== Other Combat Details =====

Critical Hits:
	Critical hits are accuracy rolls that land inside your critical hit range 
(aka. crit chance). If you roll a critical hit, your weapon does +20 damage for 
that attack (and/or other effects, depending on your abilities). By default, 
everyone starts with a critical hit range of "1", meaning, an attack roll of a 
10 would be considered a critical hit. But your critical range may not be "1" 
because your Luck modifies your critical hit range: (Luck Modifier/10), round 
down, is added to your critical hit range. Which means, if you have a Luck stat 
of 8 (and thus, by the equation, +1 to your critical hit range), an attack roll 
of 9-10 would be considered a critical hit.

	Weapons with a high fire rate cannot critically hit (weapons that shoot more 
than 1 bullet per Action by default).

Armor and Getting Hit:
	When a player is defending against a successful enemy hit, they roll 
Percentiles under their armor in order to see if their armor blocked the bullet, 
and from there, how much damage they receive. If the defending player has no 
armor, they armor roll for a target 50 Percentile. If the armor roll is 50% or 
above, they receive half-damage. Below 50%, full damage.

	Armor consists of 3 concepts: Armor Points (APs), Armor Piercing level (APL),
and % Coverage. Starting from the end, Coverage is simply the percentile that 
you have to roll under to see if armor was hit. If the attack misses armor, or 
rolls over 50%, it does half damage because the bullet is hitting a less vital 
part of the body. If the attack hits armor: Armor Piercing level (APL) comes 
into play. 

	APL is a unitless number that represents how well a weapon can pierce armor or
how well armor can block bullets. If the attackers weapon's APL is less than the
defenders armor's APL, all damage is blocked. If the weapon's APL is greater than
or equal to the armor's APL, then Armor Points (APs) come into play. 

	APs are, effectively, your armor's ability to slow down projectiles as they
pass through it. Whenever armor is successfully pierced, all damage is first inflicted
on APs. Once the APs are used up, all remaining damage goes to health. APs refresh at the
start of the armor wearer's turn.

Shields:
	If you are looking to defend against Lasers or Plasma, you're in the right 
place. Every laser-toting plasma-fuming space hooligan will be looking to turn 
you into space-bacon ('spacon' for short) on your adventure; shields will slow 
that process down. If you are hit with a laser, shields absorb 100% of the 
damage, reducing the shield's strength by the damage taken. If you are hit with 
a plasma weapon, the shield absorbs 50% of the damage, and the rest passes 
through to the next line of defense (either armor [if present] or the 
character's body). If the Shield's Strength is reduced to 0, all remaining 
damage passes through unabated.

	As long as the Shield's Strength isn't reduced to 0, the shield will 
recharge 'Recharge Rate / Turn' number of points at the start of the wearer's 
turn. If the Shield's Strength is reduced to 0, you must wait a "Shield Restart 
Time" number of turns before the shield will restart at "Recharge Rate" 
strength. If you get hit with a weapon/by melee during that time, you must start 
your "Shield Restart Time" over again. 

	If you don't want to wait that long, at the start of your turn you can pay 
the "Fast Recharge Nanites" cost to restart your shields. Or if your Shield's 
Strength is just damaged, at the start of your turn you can pay the "Fast 
Recharge Nanites" cost to boost the Shield's Strength by an extra "Recharge Rate 
/ Turn" (in other words, 2x "Recharge Rate / Turn" instead of the normal 1x).

Shock:
	When players take more than 70 damage, they must roll a Shock save at a DC 
of the damage taken. On fail they pass out. on success they stay conscious. When 
players fail, they may roll each turn at a DC of 70 to wake up. They continue to 
roll either for (15 - FORT) turns, or until they pass.

Stealth Attacks:
	If you are hidden (undetected by an opponent) when you initiate an attack 
action, you incur bonuses depending on the circumstances of the attack.

	Ranged weapon stealth-attacks (including explosive grenades but not any 
other thrown weapons) have -1 miss chance to hit if 'adequate' aiming time is 
given (DM's discretion: how rushed you are, or how skilled you are at stealth, 
etc). Ranged weapon stealth-attacks gain +20 bonus damage.

	If you stealth-attack a target in melee, your target has a guard DC of 0. If 
you have at least 10 skill in melee combat and you attack from stealth, Thrown 
and Melee (non-explosive/non-grenade) weapons deal 2x BASE Damage*, up to 150 
maximum damage** (critical/BONUS damage is not doubled, but added on to the 2x 
Base Damage). If you critically hit, you ignore the opponent's armor and deal 
full damage. Or, as normal, (see section, "melee combat") if you roll 3+ above 
your miss chance (3+ above the opponent's guard DC), you ignore the opponent's 
armor and deal full damage. Signifying that the target gets hit in whatever you 
deem to be the most vulnerable; i.e., the head, neck, or the chest (over the 
heart, etc). 

*Base Damage is typically the damage of the weapon without any other character 
bonuses, but Base Damage can be increased by certain classes and abilities.

**Increases to 200 max damage at level 10.

Flanking:
	If you are behind a target, aka flanking, your melee attacks gain +2 bonus 
accuracy against their Guard DC. (Ranged attacks don't gain a specific bonus 
from flanking.)

===== Ranged Combat =====

	If a player or opponent is standing outside of cover and they are shot at, 
after the first firing action (assuming they didn't die or go unconscious), 
they immediately, 'Hit the Dirt'. When you Hit the Dirt, you dive to the ground,
going prone, within a 2m range of where they stood (DEX movement rules apply 
as normal). Hitting the dirt consumes the 1st action of their next turn.

	To fire, you must be within the longest range limit of your gun*, i.e. be at 
a distance smaller than your gun's largest Range Bracket**, and you must not be 
out of ammo. You can aim and fire or, more simply, just fire at a target. If you 
shoot without aiming, you are "Hip Firing" and incur additional aiming penalties 
(see Hip Firing, below). 

*Actually you can fire at any range you like, but you won't necessarily hit anything.
Except for air, you will always hit air (unless you're in space).

**You cannot shoot weapons at a distance of over 100m without magnifying sights 
or over 150m without 2x+ magnification.

	Aiming at an enemy requires one action but significantly increases the 
effectiveness of your fire. Taking aim requires that you select a particular target 
that you can either perceive directly or have a high confidence in its current 
position. You must be able to see or otherwise percieve the target clearly, but they 
do not have to be within your weapon's range. Against this target only, ranged attacks 
follow the normal, non-Hip Fire rules. Characters may cease aiming as a free action, 
for example to aim at a different target. Additionally, aim is ceased automatically 
in any of the following circumstances: 

* The target dies***.
* The target moves a large distance unexpectedly****.
* The aiming character hunkers.
* The aiming character is thrown (for example, by a frag grenade).
* The aiming character suffers impairment to his or her primary sense (such as from a flashbang).

***As an optional rule, if a character's aim target dies, and the death was not 
unexpected, then the character may shift aim to another target within 5m of the first 
as a Free Action. DM discretion is advised for close combat situations.

***Possibly by coming out of cover 5+ meters from the last known location.

	Aiming is relatively simple and does not need to be treated with excessive
formality. If a character could reasonably take or keep aim at something, then he or 
she can.

Fire Rates:
	Most weapons are Semi-Auto, meaning that each time you pull the trigger, the 
gun fires once and chambers a new round automatically. It takes 1 Action to fire 
a semi-auto weapon in this way. Some guns, such as Shotguns and Bolt-Action 
sniper rifles require 2 Actions to fire the gun, where the first Action is a 
trigger pull, and the second Action is the rechambering of the weapon. Some weapons
are capable of higher rates of fire, like Assault Rifles. These weapons often have
more than one fire mode such as Fully-Automatic (Auto) and Burst. Auto or Burst 
mode allows the user to fire 6 or 3 shots for 1 Action, respectively (unless
otherwise noted). 

Rolling a Ranged Attack:
	To hit a target, Players must roll a d10 that is over their weapon's miss 
stat. When an enemy is in cover, their cover score is added to your weapon's 
miss chance. Lets say your normal ranged miss chance is 2, and the enemy is in 
full cover, your miss chance is increased by 4, for a final DC of 6. So a roll 
of 7-10 would be successful.

Gun Jams:
	If at any time that you are firing a gun and you roll a weapon accuracy of 1,
roll a second d10. If that second d10 roll is a 1 or 2, the weapon Jams, 
necessitating a weapon skill check, DC 60. 

Hip Firing:
	Add 3 to a weapon's miss chance. You cannot use optical attachments in hip 
firing unless otherwise noted. It is much smarter to takes one action to Aim, 
and spend the rest of your shots firing. It's also a great idea to take an 
action at the end of your turn to "hunker," and gain a +2 cover advantage.

	If your weapon has a minimum distance (usually because of a high-powered
scope), and you fire inside that distance, you are forced to hip fire.

Blind Firing:
	Add 6 to a ranged weapon's miss chances. Blind firing allows you to shoot 
around cover without looking or putting yourself at risk. You can blind fire 
while hunkered. Your blind fire miss chance is affected by your base weapon miss 
chance(s), not affected by attachments unless otherwise noted, reduced by PER 
stat combat bonus (as usual), and reduced by LUCK stat combat bonus. It's 
recommended to calculate this separate miss chance and write it down before 
combat.

Using Cover/Stances:
	Chances are, if an enemy can see you in Compound X, they can hit you. Using 
cover will make you harder to be hit. You will encounter many types of cover 
while adventuring throughout the galaxy. Many small objects provide only partial 
cover, either by partially obscuring your silhouette, or by providing slight 
protection from projectiles. Full cover will do both to a better degree. 
"Partial Cover" typically covers 30-50% of your body, whereas "Full Cover" will 
cover closer to 60-80%. Crouching or going prone will also take better advantage 
of your surroundings and make you a smaller target. Debuffs to opponents' Miss 
Chances are as follows:

No Cover: +0
Partial Cover: +2 
Full Cover: +4
Crouching: +1 (on top of whatever cover you're behind, may completely obscure vision)
Prone: +2* 
Hunkering: +2 (on top of whatever cover you're behind.)

*(on top of whatever -partial- cover you're behind, otherwise, may completely 
obscure vision. Does not provide a bonus against an opponent that is within 5m 
of you if you aren't in cover from their perspective.)

	Crouching is a free action, and standing up costs 1 Action. While you are
crouched, you have -1 movement speed per action (minimum 1) and you cannot
sprint or use other movement abilities.

	Going prone costs 1 Action, and standing up costs 1 Action. Lying flat down on
your chest makes you a smaller target and helps you aim better, but also makes you
easier to hit in melee. -1 gun miss chance while prone and +2 chance to be hit in
melee. Being prone severely limits your movement: 1/2 movement speed while prone, 
round-up; maximum 2 movement per action.

	Hunkering costs 1 action, and you cannot fire your weapons except by blind-fire 
(see Blind Firing, above). Imagine curling up in a ball, to pose the absolute smallest
target possible. Its a free action to un-hunker.

Reloading:
	When a gun runs out of ammunition, the user must pause to reload. "But how 
long do I gotta be outta the battle?" Great question!

	Each gun has a "Reload DC," rated based on the skill and brevity of the 
weapon's reload. For example, an assault rifle, which has a very obvious 
magazine release button and protruding magazine, has an average DC of 30%. More 
complex weapons, such as high-precision sniper systems or exotic sub-machine 
guns might have a higher DC, maybe 40%. If the Player passes the reload, then 
the reload time is standard. For Box-Magazine fed Semi- and Fully-Automatic 
weapons, this is 2 Actions. Other, more complex weapons will specify their 
reload time. On a critical reload success (effected by luck as normal, anything 
in the 90-100 range caused by a raw roll or by adding your weapon use skill),
the reload time is halved (for Bolt-Actions it is reduced to 1 Action). On a 
failure, the reload time takes twice as long.

== Suppression == 

	Every player with a ranged weapon gets the option to Suppress as the last 
action of their turn. Suppression, also known as, "laying down fire", 
"covering fire", or "suppressive fire" is the art of shooting a hail of 
bullets (as accurately as possible) to try and prevent the enemy from 
effectively fighting back while your team maneuvers. Suppression comes in
three flavors: light, medium, and heavy; these indicate how wide of an area
is suppressed as well as how effective that suppression is (defined below).
The type of suppression available to you is dependent on your weapon.

	When you Suppress, you aim at the target as part of the action and fire a
hail of bullets (within your weapon range). Suppression doesn't require any
rolls to initiate, the suppressor simply fires, creating a light/medium/heavy
suppression AOE (Area-of-Effect, typically a 1-3m circle). Even though Suppression
is an AOE effect, if you cross in-front of someone (someone who is suppressing 
a different person) you will likely trigger automatic attack rolls, DM's discretion.

	If a suppressed target moves out into the open (see below), they 
trigger automatic attack rolls (or automatic hits) by the suppressor, once 
per target per suppressor's turn. If the suppressed target shoots, they 
fire with +1 miss chance, not-stackable. Suppression status can't be purged 
unless you move outside the AOE. The only other way to stop being suppressed 
is to stop the suppressor from using a suppression action on you at the end 
of their turn.

	If the suppressor cannot physically hit you (such as being completely behind 
an impenetrable barrier) you are not suppressed. The suppressor doesn't need to 
see you to hit you, as in the case of suppressing a cloaked target. 

Light Suppression:
	As the last action of your turn, aim at a target and fire 3 rounds (or the 
rest of your magazine, at least 1 round has to be fired) to suppress 1m radius 
AOE around the target. The target takes a +1 miss chance malus until the start 
of your next turn, and if the target moves out into the open**, then roll an 
immediate reaction to hit the target with a (non-automatic fire) accuracy roll. 
Immediate reactions are stackable on a per-weapon basis.

Medium/Moderate Suppression:
	identical to light suppression with the following exceptions, you must fire 
6 rounds from the current magazine to achieve 'moderate', and you don't have to 
roll to hit -- you automatically hit and roll armor.

Heavy Suppression:
	identical to light suppression with the following exceptions: you must fire 
10 rounds from the current magazine to achieve 'heavy', you don't have to roll 
to hit -- you automatically hit x2 and roll for armor. You suppress all targets 
within a 2m radius AOE around the primary target.


**"Moving out into the open" includes moving into a new location while you can
be hit by shots from the suppressor (this excludes moving into complete concealment,
such as going prone behind a high concrete wall). For example, the following situations
would trigger a free hit by the suppressor and give you the 'suppressed' status
while remaining in the area (let's assume you are upright (not crouched or prone)):
moving from partial cover to an adjacent partial cover, moving from complete concealment
behind a barricade to partial cover, and moving when you are caught out in the open.
	If the suppressor cannot physically hit you (such as being completely behind an 
impenetrable barrier) you are not suppressed. The suppressor doesn't need to see 
you, to hit you.

==============================
Damage Types and Armor Types
==============================

	There are 5 main types of damage in compound X: Ballistic (conventional 
firearms, bows), Laser, Plasma, Explosive (concussive), and melee. Additionally, 
some Ballistic, Laser, and melee weapons can deal non-lethal variants. These 
damage types interact differently with the two types of protection: Armor and 
Shields. 

===== Damage Types =====

Ballistic Weapons:
	Ballistic weapons are straightforward: they are blocked by armor and ignore 
shields. Any damage that defeats armor damages health.

Plasma Weapons:
	Plasma interacts with both armor and shields. Armor's effectiveness is 
reduced by 1 APL when hit by plasma. Targets hit with plasma, that pierces armor, 
take (stackable) plasma burn. For Shields, Plasma deals half damage to the 
shielding, plus inflicts plasma burn and any remaining damage on the wearer 
(only if their armor is pierced, of course). 

Laser Weapons:
	Lasers are completely blocked by shields, dealing all of their damage to the 
shielding. Lasers deal full damage to armored targets; If a player wearing 
ballistic armor is hit with a laser, they receive damage as if they weren't 
wearing any armor.

Explosives:
	Certain grenades and devices have Explosive (concussive) damage. Explosive 
Damage ignores armor and shields (explosive damage is essentially, a crushing 
force). Fragmentation grenades are considered ballistic weapons, as their 
primary damage delivery method is shrapnel. 

Melee/Melee Weapons:
	Melee damage is treated like ballistic damage unless you hit a target's 
armor and don't pierce it. If you are fighting a being with body armor, and you 
hit the targets armor but don't pierce it, you then deal a special kind of 
concussive damage (called blunt damage) that ignores armor but you can only deal 
1/2 damage, up to a max of 25 damage. Max of 35 damage if you are using a melee 
weapon (like a club, sword, or even hitting them with your gun).

Electric Damage:
	Some damage is delivered to characters with a high current and voltage. This
can lead to burns, organ failure, fried circuits and chaotic effects on the 
nervous or control systems of a given character. This damage does not have any
special effect on armor, but certain characters are more prone to electric 
damage than others, while some characters are more resistant to it.

Fire Damage:
	Some damage is inflicted with conflagrations or general combustion. While
this damage usually leaves an ongoing burning effect, this damage type does not
imply that simply by being Fire Damage. Please read a given attack or event 
carefully to see if you are simply burned once, or have an ongoing effect as
well. Some characters are more resistant to fire than others. Similarly, some
armor in the game helps mitigate fire damage more effectively than others. 

Acid Damage:
	Some damage occurs when a substance of a significantly different PH balance
comes in contact with your player and chemically reacts in an adverse manner.
Such cases are usually painful and smell bad. 
	While taking acid damage doesn't always mean that you have an ongoing 
effect, read the source of the damage carefully to see if in addition to the 
one-time damage effect, you also have an ongoing effect to deal with as well. 
Acid damage can affect armor adversely as well, but that is not implied simply 
by an attack being labeled with acid damage. Such effects will be listed 
separately in the attack, trap, etc.

Internal Damage:
	Internal damage can be sustained from things like parasites, malicious
microbots, or simply pushing your character's physical body past its breaking
point. Unless otherwise stated, internal damage always deals full damage and
ignores armor. 

===== Protection Types =====

Armor:
	Ballistic Armors (or more simply, Armor) are the first type of protective 
measure that you will come across. When armor is shot by a ballistic weapon, the 
armor may reduce or fully block damage before the character's health is damaged. 

Shields:
	CS Shields (or more simply, Shields) are the second type of protective 
measure that you will come across. Shields normally protect against Plasma and 
Lasers but not against ballistics.  

	Beyond weapon damage, there are also environmental threats to consider. An 
important note is on fall damage. A player can fall up to their Dex/2 in 
meters before needing to roll an acrobatics check. If the surface they are 
landing on is somehow fouled, the GM may require the player to roll an 
acrobatics check when landing from any height at their discretion. On a failed 
roll, take damage equal to 2 times the height fallen. The player also incurs 
one injury, depending on the severity of the fall. Some examples are below:

* Sprained ankle(s)
* Broken ankle(s)
* Broken leg(s)
* Broken arm(s) in addition to leg(s)
* Broken everything

==============================
Casting Spells
==============================

	There are a few classes which are able to cast spells, Paladins, Mages and 
Sorcerers. Casting spells is very similar to performing other actions. 
Normally, a spell takes one action to cast. The performer of the spell will 
have to pass a Skill DC in order to successfully cast the spell. This DC is 
the number of Nanites used to cast the spell, plus an bonuses the target gains 
from cover. For Mages and Sorcerers this is a Spellcast DC, and for Paladins 
this is a Knowledge [Nanites] DC. Mages/Sorcerers can add any skill points 
they have in Sorcery to their rolls, and Paladins may do the same with their 
Knowledge [Nanites] skill. Some spells may also require the target to make a 
saving throw in order to avoid the spell or negate its effects. Generally 
speaking, spells have a range that is dependent on either the Charisma score 
of the caster or the Charisma Modifier.

==============================
Cloaking
==============================

	Cloaking is available to some classes as a class feature.
 
===== Cloaking Modules =====

	Expend the cloaking module's "Nanite Activation Cost" to begin cloaking. At 
the ending of every turn thereafter, you have to pay a "Nanite Upkeep" cost to 
continue cloaking.

	Wearers need only expend Nanites for the "Nanite Upkeep" cost at the end 
of a turn that they perform actions. Cloaking requires concentration so when you 
are doing nothing but watching, you may cloak for free.

	You can remain cloaked for a number of turns equal to ["Cloak Turns" + your
cloaking module's "Cloak Turn Bonus"] or when you run out of Nanites, whichever 
occurs sooner (see table below for "Cloak Turns") . If your cloak time runs out, 
you stop cloaking and have to wait a number of actions equal to your "Charge 
Delay" (listed under the relevant cloaking module's description) before being 
able to cloak again.

===== Cloaking Detection =====

	If someone/something is looking for you, they must pass a (normally, 
perception) check at 'Detect DC' difficulty, modified by your stealth skill. 
While moving, the detect DC is reduced (listed as 'moving detect DC' under the 
relevant cloaking module's description). There is a tell-tale shimmer in the 
cloak, as the micro-foil has a hard time keeping up with moving environments. 
Once the wearer has settled down, the micro-foil is able to reproduce the 
surrounding environment better and will stabilize.

	When using a skill (accessing a terminal, fixing something, etc.) use your 
reduced, 'moving detect DC' as you are diverting your attention. However, once 
you have performed a combat action, the cloak fizzes out.
