==============================
Premise
==============================

	Welcome to Compound X! The specific time and place that your adventure takes
place is up to your Game Master (often called a GM for short), but all of them
take place far in the future where humans have left earth on their faster-than-light
spaceships to explore dangerous new worlds fraught with friend and foe of all
manner of robots and aliens! 

	Will you be the dashing hero? Or perhaps the evil villain plotting galactic 
domination? Or maybe a mercenary who's somewhere in between? The choice is
yours and your legend will be told as you play the game!
 
==============================
The Primary Game Mechanic
==============================

	You may now be thinking to yourself; "Self-person, we sure can't wait to go
gallivanting through the galaxy doing fantastic things and seeing the beautiful
galaxies! But how would we do that?" Well, yourself doesn't have the answer yet,
but good news! You just found it!

	In Compound X, most things you will do will be accompanied by a 'roll'. That 
translates to rolling the dice. Rolling the dice is our way of factoring in
the human (or not human) tendency to do things in a way which isn't perfect.
When you roll high, you do very well. When you roll low, you goof up. But hold 
your horses, or kangaroo or what have you. This is a strategy RPG, not a gambling game.
Each roll will have numbers which you will add to or subtract from the one you 
get from the dice. This represents how good or bad your particular character is
at doing whatever it is you are attempting to do. What to add when is discussed
in detail below. 

	Now, there will be two kinds of rolls your character will be making. 
A skill roll, and a combat roll. Skill rolls use two ten-sided die, to represent 
a d100, which in turn represents a percentage. One die is designated as the tens 
place, and the other die as the ones place. However, in combat, you will use one d10, 
which is reflected in a single number system.  Most dice sets come with two
D10s, one with a zero after the number on the face, the other without that zero.
In that case, obviously you add the numbers on the face of the dice together to
find out what you rolled. If your dice came from different sets, you must pick
which dice represents the tens place before you roll. i.e. if one die rolls a
40 and the other rolls a 6, you rolled 46%. Alternatively, if you have an orange
die which represents your ten's place and a purple die which represents your one's
place, and you roll an orange 3 and a purple 9 then you rolled 39%.

	It's important to note that you don't have to roll for everything. Your 
character probably knows how to do mundane things like brush their teeth, open 
an unlocked door, and tie their shoes. It's okay to just do these things, even 
in combat.

Rolling with Advantage:
	Sometimes circumstances or the occasional feat may prompt you to make a roll 
with Advantage or Disadvantage. In such cases you make the roll twice. With 
Advantage you take the better roll, while with Disadvantage you take the worse 
roll. Advantage and Disadvantage do not stack with themselves. If you would have 
both Advantage and Disadvantage on the same roll, then they cancel each other, 
and you just roll once.

==============================
Role Playing and Combat
==============================

	Compound X has two main 'modes' if you will: Combat, and Not in Combat. 
While in combat, the rules are a little more specific so as to support strategy 
and planning. During combat, each player takes their turn in a particular order, 
and while you can still make up what you want to do, most actions fall into 
pre-existing categories that take a specific amount of time and typically do a 
specified amount of damage. More detail on that in the "Combat" section of Basic 
Rules.

	Out of combat, turns are a little more fluid. Usually players take their turn 
describing what they want to do when each player gets an idea of what to do. If 
two players have an idea at the same time, please be courteous and take turns. 
It's much easier for the GM to listen to one player at a time. In addition to 
taking turns, please also be polite and share the spotlight. You ALL are the 
main heroes or villains of this story. Make sure everyone gets a chance to do 
the one-liner they want, or to have their moment of glory.

	Either in combat or out, play usually follows this loop:

1.	The GM describes the environment and the situation. Usually the DM will ask "What do you want to do?"
2.	The player describes what they want to do
3. 	The GM checks if that's even a possible thing that can be done. (skip this step if that's obvious)
4.	The GM says what kind of roll is needed to see if the player succeeds, if any roll is necessary.
5.	The player rolls the dice and adds the numbers as described below.
6. 	The GM checks the total against the DC and narrates what happens*
7.	Then the next player begins their turn.

*The DC stands for "the Difficulty Challenge", a number that
typically only the GM knows which represents how hard a typical task
is. Then the GM narrates how the action goes depending on if the 
player succeeds or fails and by how much.

==============================
Your Character
==============================

	In Compound X, you control one particular person. This person is your avatar
in the game world. You decide what they say, how they react and what they do
just by telling your Game Master at the appropriate time. But before you can
jump right in and start playing, you need to create a character! This is often
one of the most fun parts of the game!

	Making a character is a slightly involved process that can take a new player 
up to two hours to fully flesh out. There are several parts of characters which
are detailed below, but let's list them here briefly before we get into the 
nitty-gritty of it.

	If you want some extra guidance after reading through the sections below, 
see the 00_New_Player_Walkthrough.txt document in CharacterCreation. Following 
its steps will give you a customized, relatively low-complexity character that 
will help you learn to play the rest of Compound X.

Base Stats:
	These decide what raw characteristics make up your character, and are 
factored into most other decisions you make both in game and for the rest of 
character creation. Choosing your stats is a very good way to start making a 
character.

Species/Race:
	Is your character a robot? What about a human? Or maybe the catlike aliens 
known as Tundari? Different species and races get small bonuses to different 
aspects of combat and are liked or disliked by different people in the galaxy 
accordingly.

Class: 
	Think of this like your job. Are you a sniper, waiting for the perfect shot? 
Or are you a pilot who can thread a needle with your starfighter? Or maybe 
you're a veteran soldier, who's seen it all. Classes define what armor and 
weapons your character can use in combat, as well as certain special abilities 
which might help solve puzzles or get you better discounts at stores. Your class 
also determines how much money you start with to buy equipment and how many 
Nanites you can use at once.

Nanites:
	The evolution of technology brought about the ability to design and control 
microscopic machines. Such a powerful advancement assists in all forms of life 
in the Compound X universe. Nanites are used to activate powerful abilities such 
as sprinting extremely fast, aiming incredibly well, infusing bullets with 
electrical energy, and more.

Skills: 
	Each character learns things while going through life. Maybe your time in 
the military taught you how to navigate using the stars or maybe your time 
working at a mechanic's shop made you good at repairing things? Or maybe you're 
one of those people who is just naturally good at hacking computers. Picking 
these numbers will represent that in the game world.

Equipment:
	Your equipment is made up of your character's weapon, armor and 
miscellaneous items. You'll get money to buy them with at the start of the game 
and you'll earn more money as you go about your adventures.

Feats: 
	Your character will gain special perks as you level up. This could range 
from reloading really fast, to having more health to being able to do a fast 
combat roll under fire. Tackle these when your character advances to level 3.

==============================
Base Stats
==============================

	Each player has what are called Base Stats. An average person has a '5' for
each stat, but an average player has a '6'. Base Stats are split into Primary
and Secondary stats. Primary stats are determined by your Base Stat points.
Secondary stats are derived from primary stats. The largest primary stat
associated with a given secondary stat determines the secondary stat's value; 
However, if you have a primary stat that is associated with more than one 
secondary stat, you may have to choose which secondary stat to contribute to.
These stats are as follows (secondary stat associations are indented):

Strength:
* Carry Ability
* Movement Speed
Perception:
* None
Fortitude:
* Carry Ability
Charisma:
* Skill Point Gain
Intelligence:
* Skill Point Gain
Dexterity:
* Movement Speed
Luck:
* None

Secondary Stat Assignment Examples: 
	Charisma and Intelligence are associated with Skill Point Gain. If you have 
5 Charisma and 6 Intelligence, you would have 6 Skill Point Gain.

	Let's now assume you have 6 Strength, 3 Dexterity, and 4 Fortitude. You would 
have 3 Movement Speed (from your Dexterity) and 4 Carry Ability (from your Fortitude). 
Now, Strength is much higher than both of those, but Strength can't determine both 
Movement Speed and Carry Ability so you have to decide whether you want:

* 3 Movement Speed and 6 Carry Ability, or 
* 6 Movement Speed and 4 Carry Ability 

	Strength determining Movement Speed is likely to be the better choice, as 
Carry Ability doesn't contribute as much to your character (see Secondary Stat 
Details, below)and you have a total of 6 + 4 = 10 points in secondary stats 
instead of 3 + 6 = 9. 

	Usually you can tell a lot about a character just by their base stats. For 
instance, a character with 9 strength and 3 intelligence is usually either a 
brutish bully or a tough but lovable teddy bear of a person. Where a character 
with 10 intelligence and 2 charisma is probably a brilliant nerd who might be 
shy or just have a terrible stutter.

	But your raw base stat is rarely used in calculations during the game. To
get the math to work out better, we usually us what is called a 'Stat Bonus'.
Stat bonuses are used very often. They are calculated by one of the two equivalent 
equations below (use whichever looks easier to you):

* Stat Bonus = (4 * Stat) - 20 
* Stat Bonus = (Stat - 5) * 4

	For instance, if you were trying to lift something heavy, your GM may tell 
you to roll a 'Strength Check' and add your 'Strength Bonus'. To do this, you 
would roll two 10-sided dice as explained in the Primary Game Mechanic above, 
and add your Strength Bonus to that. Let's say that you rolled a 71, and your 
Strength Base Stat is a very beefy 8. Then your Strength bonus would be:

	(8 - 5) * 4 = 3 * 4 = 12

	and the score of your roll would be 

	71 + 12 = 83

	That's a really high roll! But that may or may not be enough to lift the 
object depending on how heavy it is!

===== Combat Stat Bonus for Ranged and Melee Accuracy =====

	These bonuses use a table instead of the above Stat Bonus equation, as 
combat accuracy rolls are played out on a d10, not a d100 scale. The two 
most-used base stats for accuracy rolls are Perception and Dexterity. The 
Perception stat affects a ranged weapon's range bracket miss chance, and the 
Dexterity stat affects melee miss chance.

== COMBAT MISS CHANCE BONUSES TABLE ==

+--------+-------------+
| Stat   | Stat Bonus  |
+--------+-------------+		
| 1      | -1.5	       |
+--------+-------------+
| 2      | -1	       |
+--------+-------------+
| 3-4    | -0.5	       |
+--------+-------------+	
| 5      |  0	       |	
+--------+-------------+	
| 6-7    |  0.5	       |	
+--------+-------------+	
| 8-9    |  1	       |	
+--------+-------------+	
| 10-11  |  1.5	       |	
+--------+-------------+	
| 12-13  |  2	       |	
+--------+-------------+	
| 14     |  2.5	       |		
+--------+-------------+
| 15     |  3	       |		
+--------+-------------+

	Drop any remaining decimal (0.5 or -0.5 becomes 0) -in other words- only use 
integers when you are writing down the final miss chances of your weapon(s). For 
example, let's say you have a basic SMG with miss chance brackets of 4, 5, and 6. 
Assuming you have 6 Perception,your PER bonus is 0.5 and thus, your gun's range 
miss chance brackets are:

	(4 - 0.5), (5 - 0.5), (6 - 0.5)  =  3.5, 4.5, 5.5

	If these are your final miss chances, you would have to drop the remainder 
and your slightly-above-average perception wouldn't make enough of a difference 
to affect your miss chances!

	But let's say you also have a Dot Sight that you can put on your SMG. The 
Dot Sight gives a bonus -0.5 range bracket miss chance (among other benefits). 
This means you now have the following range brackets:

	(4 - 0.5 - 0.5), (5 - 0.5 - 0.5), (6 - 0.5 - 0.5)  =  3, 4, 5

	Perfect! Now your Perception and Dot Sight bonuses, together, reduce your 
range bracket miss chances by 1 point. If you don't have any other bonuses (from 
other attachments, feats, or abilities) then you would write down 3, 4, 5 as 
your range bracket miss chances.

	If your gun has automatic and/or burst fire, you'd add its associated miss 
chances to your range bracket miss chances and separately write down those 
numbers (after all bonuses to range bracket miss chance and bonuses to automatic 
or burst fire). In other words, if you have a ranged weapon with semi-auto, 
burst, and automatic fire modes, then you should write down 3 sets of 3 miss
chances; one set for each of the 3 fire modes. For example, let's now assume 
your gun has a burst fire miss chance of 1 and an automatic fire miss
chance of 3, your ranged bracket miss chances should look something like this...

0-10m, 11-20m, 21-40m	range brackets
  3,     4,      5    	semi-auto miss chances
  4,     5,      6	burst fire miss chances
  6,     7,      8	automatic fire miss chances

===== Primary Stat Details =====	

Strength (STR):
	How strong are you? This stat determines how big of a gun you can carry and
how hard you can punch or hit with strength melee weapons. It might also allow 
you to solve puzzles with the brute force approach.

	If you have 1 Strength, you are exceptionally weak and your max movement per
2 actions is 2m (unless your Dex is 1) and you cannot wear armor that offers more 
than 50% coverage.

Perception (PER): 
	Your ability to see, hear, smell and sense the world around you, as well as
to interpret what those sensations indicate. Perception affects your weapon 
accuracy and ability to cut through the chaos of battle to stay oriented. A high
perception makes you harder to sneak up on. 

	If you have 1 Perception, you are partially blind, only have 1 eye, or
something similar. You cannot use the Investigation or Spotting skills and you have a 
-20 malus to Insight skill rolls. 

Fortitude (FORT): 
	How tough are you? Fortitude determines your maximum health, how hard you 
are to knock off of your feet, and contributes to your saving throws.

	Your Maximum Health = 50 + 10 * FORT

	If you have 1 Fortitude, you are exceptionally frail. You can't inflict lethal 
unarmed damage and your unarmed damage is halved. Also, when you deal melee damage, 
you inflict half of the damage on yourself.

Charisma (CHA): 
	How good are you at communicating with those around you? Charisma affects a 
number of interpersonal skills like haggling and diplomacy. It also contributes 
to how hard it is to dominate your will.

	If you have 1 Charisma, you are profoundly unlikable and bad at influencing
and working with others. You cannot assist or be assisted when making skill
checks. 

	Furthermore, despite being unlikable, you still have the same psychological 
need that all sentient life has, to be social and to be accepted. At least once 
between every other encounter, you must socialize with another sentient 
character. Doing so requires a charisma check of DC 60. If the character that
you socialize is happy and willing to spend time with you, you may have 
advantage on the roll. If the character does not acquiesce to socialize with you,
they are immune to the penalty. If they do acquiesce and you fail, you both must
pay the penalty. The penalty for failing to socialize is to feel isolated and
Lonely. Please see "Lonely" in the conditions list in "01_02_Conditions.txt"

	If you have 6 or more Charisma you gain the feat "Will to Survive". The feat 
scales depending on how many points you have in Charisma. Or, if you have 9 or 
more Charisma, you get to choose between taking feat "Will to Survive" or feat 
"Positional Mastermind". 

Intelligence (INT): 
	How smart are you? Intelligence determines how quickly you acquire new 
skills when you level up and how proficient you are at using some of those 
skills.

	If you have 1 Intelligence, let's just say, you aren't particularly smart. 
You cannot attempt to use any skill that you do not have Proficiency in (see the 
"RP / Using Skills" section).

	If you have 9 or more Intelligence you are exceptionally gifted and gain 
additional feats at certain levels; for more information, please see the 
"LEVELING-UP TABLE" below.

Dexterity (DEX): 
	How nimble are you? Dexterity determines your maximum move speed in combat, 
as well as how much damage you do with finesse melee weapons like knives. 
Dexterity also contributes to skill checks for doing things with a character's 
body like climbing, jumping, or dancing.

	If you have 1 Dexterity, you are especially clumsy or suffer from a 
debilitating illness which affects your ability to move swiftly and precisely. 
You cannot learn any skills that use Dexterity as the contributing stat (for 
example, Sleight of Hand).

Luck (LUCK): 
	Some people are just lucky! A GM will often have you roll luck to see if a 
door was left unlocked or if you just happened to duck to pick up a coin off the 
ground right when an assassin is trying to shoot you in the head. Luck also has 
a significant effect on what loot you find in dungeons and your chance to roll a 
critical hit.

	If you have 6 Luck or more, you gain feat "Lucky". The feat scales depending
on how many points you have in Luck.	

	If you have 1 Luck, it goes without saying, you are very unlucky. At the 
start of a combat encounter, roll a d10 and receive a penalty from the Black Cat 
table, below.		

===== BLACK CAT TABLE =====	
+-------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Roll  | Effect                                                                                | 
+-------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1-2   | Your primary weapon malfunctions/breaks and you cannot use it until DC 60 repaired    |
+-------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 3-4   | You cannot critically hit or critically succeed (in any form) in this encounter       |
+-------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 5-6   | You trip and hurt yourself, take 15 damage and lose three actions from your 1st turn  |
+-------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 7-8   | Mental breakdown, roll DC 75 Will save or gain status effect 'Fear' of enemies        |
+-------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 9-10  | Nothing bad happens... this time                                                      |
+-------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


===== Secondary Stat Details =====

Movement Speed:
	Your speed in meters, for every two actions. Use (Movement Speed)/2 for one 
action (drop the remainder). For more information, see topic "Movement and 
Sprinting", below.

Carry Ability:
	Cancels out movement speed penalties. Carry Ability allows you to carry 
heavier weapons or heavier armor without slowing you down. If you have 6 Carry 
Ability and 6m of movement speed penalties, you end up with no movement speed 
penalties.

Skill Point Gain:
	Determines wow many skill points you gain every level. Every time you level up, you 
gain skill points according to your "Skill Point Gain". You may gain a maximum of
60 skill points in a single skill. In addition, each time you level up, you may gain a
maximum of 6 points in any one skill by using your Skill Point Gain. Skill gained from
Feats and Class passives counts towards the maximum of 60 points per skill, but not
towards the maximum skill increase per level.

===== Nanites =====

	Although not a primary or secondary stat per se, The maximum number of 
Nanites you can use at a given time is determined by your character class and an 
associated primary stat. Your class may tell you its "Class Primary Attribute" 
is Strength. In that case, Strength * 10 is your maximum Nanites. 

More generally:
	Your Maximum Nanites = (Your Class's Primary Attribute) * 10
Some class feats and other abilities can increase the number of Nanites you can 
hold and use at a given time. Also, Unlike Health, Nanites regenerate during 
combat at a rate of 3 Nanites per turn. 
	

===== Assigning Stats to a New Character =====

	When making a new character, you'll have to assign their Base stats.
This will tell you a lot about your character. When assigning your stats,
no stat can be higher than a 9 before applying racial/species bonuses and
no stat can be lower than a 1 after applying racial/species bonuses. 

	Additionally, even after race/species bonuses, feats, equipment, and base stat 
bonuses from leveling, no stat can ever be over 15 until your character is 
level 15. After level 15, the limit for stat points is 20. The number of 
initial base stat points that you have to apply is listed with your Race or 
Species. See chapter 1: Races if you haven't yet. 

===== Assigning A Class to your Character =====

	Most Characters start at level 1 so the Player will choose a Class for that 
Character at that time. A Character will only ever have one Class at a time, and
under normal circumstances, cannot change their class once it is picked. 

	On occasion (especially for new Players), a character may start at level 0 
with no Class. This is usually for a tutorial mission and a Class is selected
when the Character has completed the tutorial and leveled up to level 1. 

===== Weapon Proficiencies =====

	Each Class comes with a specific list of Weapon Proficiencies. If your 
Character has a proficiency with a type of weapon, then they can use that weapon
in combat and can purchase weapons of that type in the world or during character
creation. If your Character lacks proficiency with a weapon, then they can't 
purchase or use a weapon of that type. 

	Note that Weapon Proficiency is different from having Proficiency with the
Skill Weapon - [X]. For details on Skill Proficiencies and Weapon SKills, see the
"RP/Using Skills" section or the Skills document.

===== Armor Proficiencies =====

	Just like each Class comes with a set of Weapon Proficiencies, it also comes
with a list of Armor Proficiencies. Just like Weapon Proficiencies, if your 
class has a Proficiency with a given armor type then they can purchase or wear
that armor type in combat. If your character doesn't have that proficiency, then
they can't.

==============================
Saving Throws
==============================

	Saving throws are used in dire or critical situations to defend against very 
negative effects.

- Will: defend against a mind affect (Ex: throw off hopelessness after crashing in an escape pod)
- Shock: maintain composure after serious damage (Ex: stay conscious after being shot by a high caliber round)
- Reflex: quickly react to an event (Ex: dodge falling debris, fire at an enemy if they leap from one piece of cover to another)
- Awareness: knowledge and understanding of surroundings (Ex: realizing someone has walked up behind you)

The equations are as follows:

- Will: 2*(Cha + Int - 6) Rational: Normally wisdom would be applied, so Will in Compound X is descried as your internal voice motivating you to endure a mental hardship.
- Shock: 2*(Fort + Int - 6) Rational: You need to recognize that you are in shock, and resist its physical effects.
- Reflex: 2*(Per + Dex - 6) Rational: In order to react quickly to an event you need to be able to see it coming.
- Awareness: 2*(Per + Luc - 6) Rational: Line of sight and concentration are integral parts to being able to detect anomalies in the area.  

==============================
Healing Injuries
==============================

	Ouch! you've just been shot! You'd better call for a Doctor or apply a med 
kit before you bleed out! "But how do I use a med kit? Or if I'm a Doctor, how 
do I stabilize and heal an ally?" I'm glad you asked. The rules are as follows:
The Medicine DC is equal to the damage dealt. On a failed skill check, no healing 
occurs. On a success, heal an amount equal to Medicine skill + DC surplus.

	For example, a Player Character is dealt 70 damage. Their Doctor has 25 
skill in medicine. Medic rolls an 86 (after adding their Medicine Skill), so they 
heal 25+(86-70) for 41 health healed.

	Individual wounds are healed individually. 3x 20-damage wounds need three 
rolls of 21 or higher before they are fully healed.

	For example, a Player Character takes 70 damage. Medic has 25 skill. Medic 
rolls an 86 (with Medicine Skill), so they heal 25+(86-70) for 41 Health. Now 
the Character still has a 29 damage deficit (70-41), so the medic would need to 
roll over a DC of 29 to heal the remaining 29 damage. (The Doctor Cannot overheal 
a wound unless otherwise stated).

	Doctors need not use a medic-kit so long as the have their medicine bag (or 
equivalent) on their person. If they do not have their medicine bag with them 
when they are trying to heal a teammate, they can make the attempt at a +20 DC.

Using a medic-kit:

	Medic-kit, non-medic user: works as if you are a medic with skill 30.

	Medic-kit, medic user: Works as normal, but add 30 to amount healed.

==============================
Resting
==============================

Short Rest:
	Taking about an hour, characters can take a Short Rest to rest and recoup 
which will restore all the character's Nanites.

Long Rest:
	Taking about eight hours, characters need to rest after a long day of 
adventuring. If you choose to stay up all night, you won't be at your best for 
the next day. Restores all of a character's Nanites.

==============================
RP / Using Skills
==============================

	The GM may ask you to roll a certain skill to see if your character can do 
something. This may be something like, "Roll Sleight of Hand to see if you can
pick the lock on that door," or it might look like, "Roll Medicine to see if 
you can patch up the gaping wound in your chest spewing blood." Anytime you 
need to Pass a Skill check, there will be a DC (Difficulty Check) you have to 
exceed in order to successfully pass the check. You must roll over the DC to
succeed at a check. The DC does not need to be given out by the GM, but if
a DC seems too high, you have the right to grumble (but seriously, ask your GM if 
something seems too difficult. There is usually a reason why tying your shoe 
takes a DC of 70% on that particular day, etc). After you have rolled, please
apply any and all relevant skills and Stat Bonuses to a roll, as instructed by your GM.
When rolling Investigation for example, you will likely add your PER Stat Bonus.

	At any time out of combat, you may decide to use one of your skills. If you 
are not pressured by imminent or immediate danger, you may "take a 100%" to take as
much time with a task as needed to roll exactly 100 on a skill check, then apply points
from relevant skills and Stat Bonuses. Some checks cannot be passed in this way. Under
normal circumstances for example, you will not be able to pass an Athletics check to
kick down the blast doors of a ship, no matter how much time you take to try.

When rushed by a time constraint or danger, you can "take a 50%" to take
slightly more time than a 1-action, in-combat check on a task to roll exactly 50 on
a skill check, then apply any skill points and Stat Bonuses.

	If you want to use a skill in combat, see the "Combat: Actions" subsection.
	
	In many cases, a character can attempt a skill check whether or not they
have invested in learning the skill; however, your GM may decide otherwise, apply
penalties to your roll, raise the DC, ask you to justify why your character can
attempt the roll, or make any other judgement they deem appropriate. 

	When leveling up you may gain up to 6 points in any one skill.
	
	Characters are considered to be Proficient with certain skills, based on
their class and background. When a character is Proficient in a skill, each skill 
point they spend in that skill upon leveling up increases that skill by two 
instead of one.

	Defenders win ties for opposing rolls.

Player Weapon Customization
==============================

	Weapon customization can be done anytime you are in a town, space station, or 
other mercantile area. Ask the GM if there are weapon shops or kiosks around, 
they should point you to one. From there you can apply upgrades and attachments.

	The GM may tell you specific attachments that are available, or they may say
you can just go about your usual customization. See the Attachments document for 
more details on the kinds of attachments you can use, and their restrictions.
