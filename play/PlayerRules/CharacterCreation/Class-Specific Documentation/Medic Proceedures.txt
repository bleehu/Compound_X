with them. They make a charisma check against their compatriot to see if 
they are successful. Regardless, the target flees.

Halucinogens only affects biologic targets.

/////	Poison: Fentanyl Derivative
Nanite Cost:60
Duration: 	engagement
Range:		Payload (use in combination with other powers)

the next 3 turns. If they fail a check, the action they were about to take is
canceled and they lose that action. If they fail three checks they pass out. 
if they pass out, they must pass a shock check of 120 to wake up. Only works
on biologic targets.



/////	Breakout
Nanite Cost:60
Duration: 	Standard Action
Range:		15m to 20m radius, with Doc as the center
Effect:		Apply a payload of poison of your choosing to every target in range.
Targets with gas masks are immune. Allies are targeted as well.

/////	Poison: CNS Override
Nanite Cost:400
Duration: 	engagement
Range:		Payload (use in combination with other powers)
Effect:		Target enters a zombie-like state as nanites enter their 
bloodstream and use protien targeting to bind to the target's central nervous 
system. The nanites emulate rare parisites that vary neurotransmitters and
stimulate axion impulses. The end result is that the Doc receives rudimentary
control over the target. Use of CNS Override protocols is experimental, prone
to failure, and very illegal in most sectors. CNS Override only affects 
biologic targets.

/////	Poison:	PAX
Nanite Cost:100
Duration: 	1 Day
Range:		Payload (use in combination with other powers)
Effect:		A target exposed to the PAX strain must pass a DC 240 Will save.
Upon losing the save, the target rolls 1d100 (2d10, one for the 10's place,
one for the 1's place as usual). If the target does not roll a 14, the target
is instantly pacified. A pacified target will not attack anyone or anything
for any reason, even if it has reason to fear for its life. It will comply
with simple commands slowly, as if in a stupor. Prolonged exposure to PAX
will result in targets ceasing to eat, sleep, or move until they starve to
death. In the event that a 14 is rolled, the target reacts badly to the PAX.
The target will enter an unsatiable rage, and will attack the nearest living
thing - bare handed if need be - with total disregard for the target's saftey.
A target that has reacted badly to PAX will never lie down. It will continue
to kill and eat any living target until it dies of overconsumption or exaustion.
PAX only affects biologic targets.

/////	Epidemic
Nanite Cost:80
Duration: 	Standard Action
Range:		30m to 35m radius, with Doc as the center

Nanite Cost:80
Duration: 	20 turns
Range:		Payload (use in combination with other powers)
Effect:		The biologic agent eats away at the target's flesh and biologic 
parts at an astonishing rate. The target takes 3d10 damage per turn for the 
duration of their afliction. They can be cured by decontamination devices or 
specially trained medics. Targets that are wearing a gas mask, but have any 
exposed biology are affected by this even if a deployment method says they 
wouldn't. Use of biologic weapons are severely frowned upon in most civilized 
regions of space.

/////	Pasteurize
Nanite Cost:60
Duration: 	Standard Action
Range:		35m
Effect:		The Doc uses their nanites to focus microwaves to steralize a 
target that they can see. 15% chance to miss. Target takes 20 burn damage,
and 20 ongoing burn damage for 5 turns unless cooled somehow. Ignore Shields,
Do not ignore armor. If this attack hits armor, ongoing damage is reduced as 
well. Ongoing damage takes effect the first round that this attack hits, at
the end of the target's turn. Pasteurize burns do not stack on each other. 

/////	Poison: Thiopental Derivative
Nanite Cost:15
Duration: 	Standard Action
Range:		Payload (use in combination with other powers)

character could procure similar substances as a role-playing item for 1EP

you don't need to worry about smuggling it anywhere.

/////	Transmission Vector

wouldn't. Use of biologic weapons are severely frowned upon in most civilized 
regions of space.

Nanite Cost:60
Duration: 	almost instantaneous
