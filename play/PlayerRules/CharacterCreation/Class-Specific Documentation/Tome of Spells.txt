			Non-Lethal Field [100]: Create a circle Charisma meters in diameter. 
			For P.Lvl turns, treat any incoming damage as non-lethal.

			character to become "downed." Your character is knocked out for

				[strength mod] meters toward your origional target. The initial target must 
				be within line of sight of you, but the attraction feild's effects goes through walls. 
				The attraction feild does not go through mag-lev tanks, large metal objects such 
				as a car or through spaceship hull plate. It will penetrate a dumpster or 
				oil drum. It will not pull a sheild door off of the wall, but it may break it
				at the GM's discression. Typical slam damage from this attack propelling
				targets into each other or into walls is 2d10 per square of forced 
				movement into an unmoving object (but this is also at the GM's 
				discression).

				Spell Point 3: Range to initial target increases to 5 * CHA
				Spell Point 4: Fort save DC increases to 100
