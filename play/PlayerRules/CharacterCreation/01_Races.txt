Tundari
Society: Tribal system, lead by a counsil of elders.

Homeworld: Tundaaari
A dry, searingly hot planet covered in planes and deserts. 70% of the planet 
is covered in water. The planet's axis of rotation is more or less upright 
relative to it's binary star system. the north pole points more towards the 
suns, and as such is a cooked wasteland, while the south pole is left in a 
more temperate, jungle climate. 90% of the annual rainfall on the planet 
occurs on this jungly southern continent.

Native Species: Tundarin
This Feline-esque especies is covered in a soft, short fur ranging in many 
colors, from browns, to oranges, blacks, greys, etc. And a multitude of paterns
(striped, splotched, dotted, etc.). They have whiskers, and very sharp teeth. 
Their eyesite is very good, and they have low-light vision. Their build is 
generally more slender and graceful, but there have been bulkier Tundarin 
observed.

Society: Tribal with leading council of elders
The planet as a whole is unified under the banner of space exploration. there 
are many nationstates coming from historical tribes. Each nationstate is led 
by a council of elders, and a head elder is elected from each council to sit 
in on the grand council which overlooks issues on a planet-wide scale. They 
are hunters by nature, with a close tie to nature. Their cities typically 
blend in with the environement, whether it be large tree cities or hanging 
cliff cities.
They typically believe in spritualism, and their level of science has been 
brought about by their religios leaders. Science is seen as a result of their
religion, rather than an explanation of it. This being the case, science is 
well taught and understood by most all Tundarin, and higher tier and newer 
prototype devices are revered as religios artifacts.
As far as the war goes, the Tundarin have been more peaceful towards humans, 
and have recently opened trade routes with the humans. While uncommon, 
Tundarin have been known to mingle with humans on occasion. Those who do have 
an understanding of Human Basic.

//============================================================
Cyborg

Society: Cybernetics advanced rapidly over the last 200 years, and it is not 
uncommon to see Cyborgs walking amongst crowds. Most of society looks down on 
their augmented bretheren, and in some places they are outcasts completely. Be 
warned if you take this race, you will be discrimintated against at some point.

Preferred Classes: Any
Type: Enhanced Organic.
Size: Medium
Speed: Normal+
Stat Modifiers: 40 point pool.
Languge: ECSC Standard

Racial Traits:
Pick any three augments (you may take a single augment no more than 2 times, 
or a combination of multiple augments. For example Occular Augment and Speed 
Geared Fine Motor Controls II might help a melee fighter increase both damage 
and hit chance.):
    Occular Augmentation: +1 Perception, Darkvision 20m.
    Enhanced Speed: +1 movement.
    Enhanced Strength: +1 STR, metal arms, legs, or both.
    Neural Implant: +1 Intelligence.
    Speed Geared Fine Motor Controls: +1 DEX, no augment to movement speed.
    Skeletal Support Structure: +1 FORT.
    Implanted Weapon: Pick a pistol from the basic weapons list. This pistol 
    is implanted in a limb. You may manipulate your limb to use this weapon at 
    the cost of a half action. While the weapon is out, that limb does not 
    operate at its normal capacities. Hands would not grasp, legs would not 
    superbly support you, etc. Subrtact the price of the weapon from your 
    class starting money. The weapon can be upgraded to another pistol with a 
    DC 25 Biomechanics check, or a DC 50 Mechanics check. It can be upgraded 
    to any CQB weapon with a DC 50 Biomechanics or DC 75 Mechanics check.
    Integrated multitool: Your fingers hide a basic toolkit, including low-
    speed motorized screwdrivers, soldering iron, wrenches, quantum spanner, 
    toothpick, pliers, sharp edge, lock pick, etc. If it fits in a leatherman,
    its plausible that it would be in this toolkit.
    Internal Reinforcing: Critical Damage threshold +5, +5 base health.
    External Reinforcing: 5 DR passive, potential for RP abilities.

Cyborgs share all weaknesses with their base race, generally humans. They 
additionaly are weak against electric damage taking an extra 50% damage.(10
damage would become 15). They are also succeptible to hacking, although they 
would not come under control, they would merely loose the use of their 
augmentations and any affected limbs. DC 80 Hack check.
Once at level 3, and every 5 levels thereafter a Cyborg may purchase an 
additional augment at the cost of $2000. They must see a cybernetics expert to
have this augment installed.
