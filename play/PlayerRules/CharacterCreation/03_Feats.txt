is bloodied after the attack, they may not make a melee attack against you with

Full-Auto weapons, etc.

holomovies. Either way, you've managed to effectively fight using a weapon

smgs, etc. While wielding dual weapons, you may fire both at the same time

for a total of 30 damage and other possible critical effects. (Instead, if you have Double Tap, you get 
+10 damage for each bullet).
You have to reload a fresh magazine in order to trigger the bonus again. In other words, you cannot use
First Shot Counts more times in one encounter than the number of fresh magazines you are carrying. If
your weapon damages an area, First Shot Counts does not take effect.

bonuses. (any teammates in such a vehicle do not take double damage)

Lucky Blind Fire: 
Prerequisites: Luck 7
There are always so many bullets flying around, you make a habit of not peaking your
