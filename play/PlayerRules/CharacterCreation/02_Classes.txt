	be powerful controllers.
	-----------------------
	Name: Consumer

=====   MONK   =====
Head to any secluded Corporate Temple and you'll find many Monks studying the
ancient texts and learning about sacred technology. Of these holy disciples, 
a few are trained to defend the Temple in case of attack. All Monks take an 
Oath to not utilize "lesser" technologies [guns, armour, and even Nanite 
packs.], for only through embracing the Higher Technologies can one Advance 
oneself to the planes of the Great Ones.
Class Primary Attribute: Dexterity
Passives: No penalty for engaging in Grappling maneuvers. Hand to hand 
Expert, 20. +20 damage to non-lethal attacks, +10 damage to lethal attacks. At
level 5, and again at level 15 all monks must head back to their home temple 
or seek a wise master to learn more advanced techniques. Until this training 
has been completed, a monk cannot proceed to the next level. Part of this 
training is also usually a Monk''s Aura shield, which reduces incoming damage
, regardless of type, by 10, and reduces melee damage by 20, but at the cost 
of 100 Nanites spent to activate the shield. Activation is a free action. 
Each shield lasts for one encounter. Monks may meditate once per day for an 
 hour to regain any Nanites lost in this way.

	Roll a Knowledge [Nanites] check, DC 50. You may teleport up to Result-50/10
