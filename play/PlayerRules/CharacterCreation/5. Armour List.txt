Any reinforced armour, the amount of Damage Reduction is rolled at the time of purchase. A Carbon-Steel Fiber Titanium Reinforced armour plate might be anywhere from 26-35 DR for its lifetime, depending on what you roll when you purchase it. These armours are a bit of a gamble, since they may provide better protection than the next tier up, or they might only provide marginally better protection than the last tier.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//Undersuits
//Various undersuits exist, providing buffs to the wearer. Undersuits are
//wearable by all classes unless otherwise stated. Undersuits provide a 
//damage reduction to any hits that miss armour. Additionally any damage
//which only affect a limb has the suit's DR applied to it. Undersuits
//count as a full set of clothing, so any clothes worn over them look out
//of place.
    //Flightsuits offer basic protection from the elements.
    //Traditionally come in Tan, Olive Drab, Wolf-Grey, Dark Earth, Black, Camo Patterns, etc.

 * NANITE CLOAKING ARMOURS
 * Devote a Portion of your nanite pool to a clocking pool.
 * Lvl 1-5 expend 15 Nanites per cloak turn. Lvl 6+ 10 Nanites.
 * Max Turns of cloak = Lvl +1; Cloaking becomes available after waiting 4 Actions.
 * Cloaking grants the wearer stealth at a DC of 50. However, when a player cloaks, enemies will not see them unless they are actively looking for the wearer. For enemies that saw the wearer cloak, the DC is 25 less.
 * Wearers need only expend nanites on a turn that they perform actions. if they are doing nothing but watching, they may cloak for free. Cloaking requires concentration, so when a user diverts their attention to perform an action, they must use some nanites to continue to hold the cloak.
