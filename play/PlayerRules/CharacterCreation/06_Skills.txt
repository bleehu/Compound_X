 *===========================================================================*/
//Dex
Acrobatics: Rolling and tumbling come naturally to you. Useful for dodging, 
jumping, balancing, and other fine body-control.
//Per
Awareness: your character''s passive perception skill including all 6 senses. This differs from being able to look intently for something particular (Search).
//Cha
Deceive: You use your silver tongue to talk your way through situations with 
ease.
//Str
Door Kicking: You''ve been trained in the subtle art of viscously and 
unceremoniously removing a door from it''s frame for rapid entry.
//Int
Hacking: Used to gain outside access to computer based systems.
//Dex
Hand to Hand: See damage rules under Weapons listing. Can be used to attack 
any opponent that has a standard health bar.
//Dex
Hand to Hand [Expert]: Experts in hand to Hand can perform feats unimaginable 
to mere mortals. They can perform silent take downs, disarmaments, and can 
fight against  edged weapons without a penalty. However, they have to have 
specifically mentioned expert training in their background. Standard mechanics,
or scientists, or farmers will not be able to use this skill. A Buddhist 
Fighting Monk on the other hand, would get this skill for free. Talk to your 
GM. For the most part, anyone can take H-H Expert as a skill, but they must 
take the Melee Combat Expert Feat.
///Int
Knowledge [X]: You may have gone to college to get a degree in X, or maybe you 
heard all about X from your local reputable information source. Either way, 
you know a lot about X. Options:
	Local
	Criminal
	Nanites
	Sorcery
	Technology
	Alien
	Military
//Int
Medicine: If health is over 50, DC 30. Any amount over 30 is restored to target
''s health. Rolls under 30 deal d10 bleed damage. If health is under 50, DC 50
. Any amount over 50 is restored to target''s health. Rolls under 30 deal d10 
bleed damage. Medicine skill checks can be performed even if untrained in 
medicine, but the user takes a -10%. Medicine packs decrease the DC by 10, 
increase the amount healed by 30, and negate bleed damage on a failed roll.
//Int
Navigate: you can read a map, congratulations. Any time you are lost, or need 
to decide where to go, this skill will channel your inner survivorman and 
enable you to have a better idea of where you should face.
//Dex
Piloting: You have been trained in the use and operation of many vehicles, and 
even if you donâ€™t recognize what it is, you can probably figure out how to use 
it in a couple of turns.
//Int
Repair: For normal damage (up to 50%) roll percents. Any percent under 50 + 
skill level repairs that much. Rolls over 50 + skill level fail. Target takes 
d10 Shock damage.
For critical damage (50% or less) roll percents. Any percent under 30 + skill 
level repairs that much. Rolls over 30 + skill level fail. Target takes d10 
Shock damage.
Can be attempted when untrained, player takes a -10% penalty instead of a 
skill addition.

Repair kits: add 30 to the percentage to roll under. Then add 30 to the points 
repaired. No negative if failed.
//Per
Search: Looting things and ransacking offices is something you''re quite fond of. Also helps whenever you are looking for something particular, rather than just sweeping the area for something of note (Awareness).
//Per
Sniping: You have a background going hunting with your dad, or maybe you went 
to marine scout / sniper school. Who cares. If it moves, breathes or thinks, 
you can hit it. Some weapons require this skill for use, and this skill can be 
used for accuracy with any gun that has a range beyond 200m.
//Dex
Stealth: The art of stealth is a blanket over the most cloak and dagger of 
actions. Good thing youâ€™re in on the secret.
//Int
Survival: Lost in the wilderness? Youâ€™re journey home will be made easier by 
your ability to read the terrain, hunt and gather, and erect basic survival 
structures..
//Int
Weapons Use (Rifles / Pistols): Pertains to clearing jams, assembling a gun, 
reloading, etc. If it has a trigger and a barrel you can figure out how to use 
it. Skill can only be applied to accuracies up to 200m.
//Int
Weapon Use (Blades): Sword care, technique, and use are all covered here. For 
your basic combat knives, long swords, Spears, etc.
//Int
Weapon Use (Exotic): Not a weapon covered above? it will fall under here. 
Space katanas, Plasma and Coilgun weaponry, and Heavy Weapons need this skill.
//Dex
Pickpocket: Misdirection, priming, and lifting. 
//Dex
Lockpicking: Making physical, mechanical, magnetic, and cryptographic locks go 
from the locked position to the unlocked position without a key. May require 
special equipment.
