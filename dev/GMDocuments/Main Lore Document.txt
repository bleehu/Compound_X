//Lore description
It is the year 2348. The Terran Empire exists as a central governing body with many outliers and colony worlds established in nearby star systems. Earth scientists have recently broken into the field of faster-than-light travel, and have miraculously developed very speedy means of travel (faster in fact than most space-fairing races would develope). By manipulating artificial gravity wells, ships are able to rip holes between two points, seeming to disappear and reapear dozens of lightyears away in a few seconds. However this speed comes at a cost, the travel is not very efficeint. Most jumps are very costly in energy, requiring weeks of recharge time in order to jump any distance, or a refuel at a local planet. They are highly inaccurate as well, often jumping up to a quarter of a billion kilometers away from their intended target, equal to a month''s journey maximum, even using state-of-the-art Bussard-Ramjet engines. The disparity between predicted and actual exit location wildly diverges proportional to the distnace jumped. The farthest distance possible to travel in a single jump is nearish to 30 LY away, any further than that and the journey to actual target may verywell take longer than 5 years with Bussard-Ramjet engines. However, there are more stable means of travel between the sectors. The Warp Lines spread radially from the Inner core in sectors 2, 4, 6 and 8. A fifth Line was being worked on in sector 3, but due to a local insurgency in the outer rim of Sec.3, construction stopped before it was finished. Before this insurgency was fully quelled, the TE was plunged into a galactic struggle on the edge of sectors two, three, and four. The end of Sec.3 Warp Line was established, allowing rapid transit to the front line of the war, but with no stops past halfway into the mid-rim.

The nearest colonies form an "inner ring," comprised of 7 planets within 15 LY from earth. farther out, up to 300 LY away are the "mid-ring" territories, numbering 8 sectors each with around 20 colony worlds. All in total, the Earth Confederacy-Colony Union (ECCU) makes up almost 200 planets, and a population closing in on 40 billion. Beyond the mid ring are the "outer territories," some unofficial colonies, corporate ventures and secret military outposts. The known mapped region of space in the milky way extends to about 400 LY from earth (mathematically speaking, the outer territories alone are 7/9 as large as the whole area of the inner and middle regions. Its a lot of area actually).

//Technology Temples
The first organization to really explore the stars close to the Sol system stumbled upon humanity''s greatest discovery: ancient temples left by a long dead super inteligent alien race. Many technologies were reverse engineered from these temples and allowed humanity to begin efficiently colonizing the stars and break away from a civilization based almost solely on Earth.
There was a large split between the minds of the Terran Empire on what should be done with the technology which lead to the formation of three major ideologies towards hyper-advanced tech: Materializers, Dematerializers, and those who were Neutral. Within each of these ideologies there are a few different Organizations researching new technology to further their own cause.


//Specific Event Reminders
HARD contact: Hostile Alien Race Detected contact warning.
FARLAND protocol: First Alien Race: Labled as Negative Disposition.
FARLAND protocol enacted sends a "flash probe" back to the nearest Inner-Rim military instalation via a randomized coordinate jump in order to warn humanity of hostile contact. The enacting ship wipes all drive data of earth and ECCU colonies, all long-range transmissions are cut and nuclear self-destruct (primed to the captain''s voice) is primed.




//post-history of humanity; common era until current day, compound x
In the late 2100s, humanity made a collective decision that it was time to move on to bigger and better things. Most of the UN nations joined together as one collective, and funded the Terran Collective Space Union. Many ships were built to search among the nearest stars for anything "interesting." At a select few of the sites, advanced and incomplete alien artifacts were discovered. From some of these designs humanity embraced in the discovery of gravitanium, from which the invention of faster than light travel was invented. With the fairly complex task of sustaiend faster than light travel out of the way, colonization began. The next 200 years saw a rapid expansion ourside of earth, and the formation of a new governing body in the Milky Way: the Earth Confederation Empire.
Over the next 100 years, rapid discovery of alien artifacts and their also rapid revese-engineerings lead to a population boom and huge rise in humanity''s understanding of space and technology. But not all of humanity was in position to benefit from some of these accomplishments. In the outer-rim, on the edge of civilised humanity, a large group of those disasisfied began to grow. An insurrection was imminent. Then, humanity was blindsided: open attacks from an alien race and the threat of extinsion.
The war rages on, and Earth even teams up with the Reformed Soviet Union, an enemy who sprang up when ECSC''s second expansion began. Modern-day ECE is locked in combat with its alien aggressors, and daily battles wear down a weakened ECE. The humans are losing by attrition alone. Victory is the furthest thing from the Human''s minds. Secrets are whisppered amongst the sumgglers, treasure hunters, soldiers, and even some average citizens, the existance of Compound X, a Precursor facility with weapons and technology of the sort that might save humanity.

//Beyond the Rim
Outside of the ECSC, there are multiple shadowy organizations, races and armies whose existance threaten humanity, and in some cases, life across the galaxy. These are the Xenos, hostile alien societies whose view of humanity is the same as you view a rodent or insect. Given the opportunity, they would erradicate humanity just because it exists. There are three major threats to the ECSC, only one of which is of offical concern.

The Atellsikor are the first hostile race encountered by humanity. They are an insectoid race who roam the galaxy, feeding off of whatever society they come across. Humanity has teamed up with a couple other races in trying to destroy the Ateliskor before they can consume all life in the galaxy.

The Astral Wraiths are a malevolent force who control whole empires from behind the scenes. Not much is known about these devious beings apart from the basics of their society. Astral Wraiths are an ancient race of evil sentient beings. They are very powerful as a race, and often live for hundreds of years, always gaining power. Many lesser Wraiths tend to find a small corner of a galaxy and make home their, each coven commanding armies and civilizations from behind the scenes.
However there exists an Astral Wraith civilization, ruled by 6 High Priests and a Grand Necromancer. The Astral Wraith Empire is made up of 6 Covensects, each headed by one of the High Preists. These covensects operate independant of one another, but will unite at the request of the Grand Necromancer King.
Each High Preist acts as the General for their Covensect''s army. Each Army is divided into 10 legions, and each legion may house many hundreds of thousands of Shades.

Millions of years ago, when the predecessors were at thei height of their knowledge and power, a dark shadow befell the Milky Way. The predecessors fought against these demonic beings for millenia until eventually they were able to lock away they Demon King in a pocket dimension, along with the vast majority of his armies. Defeated and without a leader, the survivors fled the galaxy, biding their time. Recently there have been whispers among the High Priests of the Astral Wraiths of sightings of Demons within the Milky Way.
The Cosmic War between the predecessors and the Demonic Army left a power vaccuum. Again, a shadow fell and the Necrophages all but destroyed the predecessors. As suddenly as they arrived, they were gone, leaving behind a fairly empty galaxy filled with relics and temples from the ruined predecessors. Even less is known about the necrophages than of the Astral Wraiths.




//========================================
// Relations with other civilizations
//========================================

Plant Race
	Sentient life which formed on a jungle planet. Their ideals are in opposition to much of what humanity holds in high esteem. This has lead to some political difficulty between the two. There is no open hostility, but they see humans as wasteful, greedy, and generally hold humanity with low esteem. Humans have a neutral view towards them, since they aren''t actively a barrier towards progress.

Silicon-based race
	Very high level of technology and contain a concscience more closely  related to the loose and adaptable neaural networks of cloud computers. They get along quite well with free Security Drones. In general they see humans as a barbaric race who still rely on mere atomic energy. Humanity envies their technological prowess but grudgingly accepts their help in the fight against the necrophages.

Tundari
	The Tundari have stayed neutral towards humanity, not wanting to provoke the "newest kitten in the litter who doesn't know the sharpness of their claws." Humanity as a whole hasn''t quite embraced the tundari, but there are trade routes established for the benefit of both societies.

The Collective of Free Units are a loose coalition of freed Constructs who have banded together for security in what is an otherwise mostly hostile galaxy. They include both Terran Security Drones and [Silicone-Based] Synthetic Units. The two have melded together, preferring the mechanical architecture of the Tarran models, and the Intelligence Networks of the [Silicone-Based] models. They have sided with their progenators[?] in the fight against the necrophages. the TE''s official political view is that this coalition is a renegade nation of Terran intellectual property, while the [Silicone-Based] acknowledge that their creations have outgrown their infancy and are free to do as they wish. This has generated some friction between delegates from TE and from [Silicone-Based].

All in all, humanity hasn''t pissed off any of the major players in the sagitaripus arm, but hasn''t done a great deal to prove that they are worthy of making friends, either. The [Silicon-Based] have a truce with both the humans and the Tundari, but are less than kind to [Plant-Race] due to millenia of intollerance for anything the [Plant-Race] view as "unnatural beings."
