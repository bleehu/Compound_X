Change armour pricing steeper, and make certain "Levels" of armour correspond to certain materials.
Level 2 = Steel Plate 10 10
Level 3 = Ceramic Plate 15 20
Level 4 = Carbon-Steel Fiber 20 30
Level 5 = Ceramic Nano-Crystal 25 40
Switch rolling of armour penitration to attacker, makes more sense that you have to roll to hit not their armour. also that way anyone with a feat that negates part of armour can add that to their roll instead of telling the defender to do that.
