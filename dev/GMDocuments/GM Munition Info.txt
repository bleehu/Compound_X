Most standard military and security units deploy a Battle Rifle or Asault Rifle with the bulk of their forces. The AR-68 is a great choice to base design off of, and in fact would have many clones. Most battle rifles and assault rifles use rounds in the range of 5.45x39 to 7.62x39.
Long rifles can be used by marksmen to pick off enemies and pin them at cover so that other units can move up.
Support and heavy weapons are actually a little rare to run across. Generally nothing larger than a 7.62 NATO round is used in a man-portable support weapon. Some autocannons or other special rifles may have larger calibers, but will also have smaller magazine size.
Sub machine guns are used by crewman like pilots and operators because of their compact size. they are also great choices for private security for the same reason.
Energy weapons aren''t generally used by military forces as they are too expensive.
