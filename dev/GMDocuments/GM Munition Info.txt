Most standard military and security units deploy a Battle Rifle or Asault Rifle with the bulk of their forces. The AR-68 is a great choice to base design off of, and in fact would have many clones. Most battle rifles and assault rifles use rounds in the range of 5.45x39 to 7.62x39.
Long rifles can be used by marksmen to pick off enemies and pin them at cover so that other units can move up.
Support and heavy weapons are actually a little rare to run across. Generally nothing larger than a 7.62 NATO round is used in a man-portable support weapon. Some autocannons or other special rifles may have larger calibers, but will also have smaller magazine size.
Sub machine guns are used by crewman like pilots and operators because of their compact size. they are also great choices for private security for the same reason.
Energy weapons aren''t generally used by military forces as they are too expensive.

//	Plasma
Plasma bolts are defined by the gas used and the bore of the barrel. A standard shot from an ECSC/Frontier Plas-20 is an Argon-.50. The Gas used determines the number of plasma burn tokens imparted on the target. Helium being a comparatively less dense plasma imparts 0 plasma tokens, while Xenon would impart 3 plasma burn tokens per shot. The bore selected will inform you of the damage output. Neon bolts are orange in color, Argon are dark blue, Krypton are green, and Xenon are a pale blue, almost white. Common combinations include:
	//Pistols
	Neon-15 mm - 60 dam, horizontal disc.
	Argon-8 mm - 55 dam, bolt.
	Krypton-12 mm - 65 dam, bolt.

	//Carbines and Automatic Rifles
	Neon-30 mm - 65 dam, horizontal disc.
	Argon-10 mm - 60 dam, bolt.
	Krypton-10 mm - 70 dam, bolt.
	Xenon-15 mm - 75 dam, bolt.
	
	//Long Rifles
	Argon-15 mm - 80 dam, bolt.
	Krypton-20 mm - 85 dam, bolt.
	Xenon-22 mm - 90 dam, bolt.

	Plasma Burn Tokens:
	Neon: 1
	Argon: 2
	Krypton: 2
	Xenon: 3

//				Weapon design guidelines
	A qualitative guide to making custom rewards for dungeons/quests/missions 
etc along with explination as to why we do what we do. This is from a game balance perspective, not a lore perspective.

//		Melee weapons
range:		In general, melee weapons should only be able to reach into the adjacent square. 
damage:		Melee weapons tend to scale damage to either DEX or STR or both. Due to the high-risk tactics the high-reward that balances it tends to be high damage when compared to primary weapons of the same level, rarity and cost.
accuracy:	While most weapons rely on perception and attatchments to enhance accuracy, melee weapons actually have their accuracy vary by a character''s skill. Which means that melee characters after level five expect to have around a -40 to miss. As such, melee weapons should have a moderately high to-miss chance by level and regardless of rarity. Also consider that closing to melee range poses a high-risk strategy. If the melee attack misses due to accuracy that is too low, it leaves	the user open to counter-attack.
cost:		Melee weapons in general should be cheaper than primary weapons of the same level, rarity, and stats. Note that most melee weapons also don''t require the constant cash drain of ammo, so they tend to be money savers for the characters that use them. As such, keep in mind that Beserkers and Assassins tend to start with less money than most other classes, but gain it quicker as their allies spend money on ammo and attatchments.

//		SMGs
range:		SMGs necessarily have a longer range than shotguns, but a shorter range than their slower-firing big brothers:
			Carbines, assault rifles and battle rifles. Don't forget that all SMGs count as CQB weapons!
fire rate:	Submachinegun's primary personality trait is the ability to send LOTS of rounds downrange very quickly. 
			SMGs have the unique trait of firing DEX/2 shots per full turn, rounding down. (DEX 5 = 2 shots, DEX 8 = 4 shots) 
			Maximum LVL + 1. Most characters that use SMGs tend to have high dex. Compromising this with small magazines or
			any other significant fire rate limiter compromises what makes an SMG distinct. So make sure when designing 
			an SMG to keep a high mag count!
damage:		SMGs tend to make up for low damage by making lots of shots per turn. SMGs may have less damage than even pistols
			of the same quality, rarity, level and cost. Due to their high rate of fire and low damage, they tend to work well
			against many weak targets, or targets with a lot of health, but little armor. While armored targets will fare 
			better because armor reduction procs per bullet. While this is true of most SMGs, you could create an SMG 
			that handles a little better against armor but sacrifices cost or accuracy without breaking the personality of
			an SMG.
accuracy:	Since SMGs fire more bullets per turn, the law of large numbers gives a better approximation of the ammount of
			damage we can expect an SMG to do; so a poorer accuracy is less debilitating for an SMG than it is for say a
			shotgun or sniper rifle. When giving an SMG an accuracy rating, remember to balance the average damage with
			fire rate, bullet damage, accuracy and range as compared to a carbine. Expect players to compensate for low 
			accuracy with weapon attatchments if possible.
cost:		In contrast to shotguns, which have expensive platforms and cheap ammo, SMGs should in general have cheap platforms
			and expensive net ammo cost. While each individual SMG round should be laughably cheap, SMGs should run through
			rounds quicker than any other weapon (with the possible exception of heavy chainguns).

//		Shotguns
range:		The range of a shotgun is the most important characteristic to deliver on this weapon's distinct personality.
			To develope the schema for the player that shotguns are a counter to enemy melee units, a shotgun's optimal 
			range must be long enough to outrange a melee weapon, but short enough to not rob SMGs of their niche. 
			Shotguns should for usablitly stay contrained to the damage breakdown of 3 meters, 10 meters, 20 meters. 
fire rate:	Shotguns typically have a slower fire rate, needing to pump a slide and change aim more often due to their
			close engagement range. But shotguns typically rely on other characteristics to maintain their distinction.
damage:		Shotgun damage at close range should be debilitatingly devestating. In order to have the stopping power 
			necessary to make the high-risk high-reward close play worth it, a hit with a shotgun shell under 10m should
			gank a non-elite enemy of the same level. As part of maintaining the personality of shotguns as a weapon class,
			a hit on an enemy between 10m and 20m should do non-negligable damage, but should deal less than a third of
			a non-elite enemy's health pool.
accuracy:	Shotguns suggest a similar high-risk, high-reward strategy to that of melee weapons. Since the risk of firing
			a shotgun comes in closing distance to your target, adding the additional risk of missing would be redundant.
			TL;DR: Shotguns should be quite accurate.
cost:		In general, shotguns themselves should be moderate to expensive, while buckshot ammo should be very cheap.
			Special ammo for shotguns changes their behavior more radically than special ammo for other weapons. This
			change in behavior modifies their apparent personality, so special shotgun shells should be very expensive
			in comparison to other ammo. i.e. dragonbreath shells should be about as expensive as plasma rounds for
			a long rifle.

				Manufacturers:

ECSC:
Common weapons, main military pretty standard arms manufacturer, much like Colt or FN Herstal.

Anvil Arms:
Started by a family of Russio-slavians. Used by Reformed Soviet Union soldiers, common among underground criminal organizations too. standard bad-guy guns. Think Kalashnikov.

RMM:
Match Grade ammunition and also some custom weapons. Think Remmington. 

G&W:
German arms manufacturer. Fairly standard in previous generation armies.

Mathews:
Old style guns. Reliable and not too costly. Also has a branch that builds custom builds that are very finely crafted.

Frontier:
ECSC R&D firm that deals in experimental weaponry for military applications and private sector security. Plasma, Lasers, Coilguns are mostly made by Frontier for humans.

Strudwick Arms:
European military armament group. Produce heavier weapons in a utilitarian package. Hedquartered in sector 5.

Level 10 and higher manufacturers:
Muzashi:

Mostly produce energy weapons and long rifles.

Zurlinsk:
A relatively small design and prototyping firm. Their claim to fame is the ZAS MkII security Drone project, predecessor to the current SDA-C drones used in the military and private sector.
Mainly produce balistic weapons, including coilguns.

Demarani:
