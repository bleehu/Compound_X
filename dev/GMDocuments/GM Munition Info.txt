Most standard military and security units deploy a Battle Rifle or Asault Rifle with the bulk of their forces. The AR-68 is a great choice to base design off of, and in fact would have many clones. Most battle rifles and assault rifles use rounds in the range of 5.45x39 to 7.62x39.
Long rifles can be used by marksmen to pick off enemies and pin them at cover so that other units can move up.
Support and heavy weapons are actually a little rare to run across. Generally nothing larger than a 7.62 NATO round is used in a man-portable support weapon. Some autocannons or other special rifles may have larger calibers, but will also have smaller magazine size.
Sub machine guns are used by crewman like pilots and operators because of their compact size. they are also great choices for private security for the same reason.
Energy weapons aren''t generally used by military forces as they are too expensive.

//				Weapon design guidelines
	A qualitative guide to making custom rewards for dungeons/quests/missions 
etc along with explination as to why we do what we do. 

//		Melee weapons
range:		In general, melee weapons should only be able to reach into the adjacent square. 
damage:		Melee weapons tend to scale damage to either DEX or STR or both. Due to the high-risk tactics the high-reward
			that balances it tends to be high damage when compared to primary weapons of the same level, rarity and cost.
accuracy:	While most weapons rely on perception and attatchments to enhance accuracy, melee weapons actually have their accuracy
			vary by a character's skill. Which means that melee characters after level five expect to have around a -40 to miss. As
			such, melee weapons should have a moderately high to-miss chance by level and regardless of rarity. Also consider that
			closing to melee range poses a high-risk strategy. If the melee attack misses due to accuracy that is too low, it leaves
			the user open to counter-attack.
cost:		Melee weapons in general should be cheaper than primary weapons of the same level, rarity, and stats. Note that most melee
			weapons also don't require the constant cash drain of ammo, so they tend to be money savers for the characters that use them.
			As such, keep in mind that Beserkers and assassins tend to start with less money than most other classes, but gain it 
			quicker as their allies spend money on ammo and attatchments.

//		Shotguns
range:		The range of a shotgun is the most important characteristic to deliver on this weapon's distinct personality.
			To develope the schema for the player that shotguns are a counter to enemy melee units, a shotgun's optimal 
			range must be long enough to outrange a melee weapon, but short enough to not rob SMGs of their niche. 
			Shotguns should for usablitly stay contrained to the damage breakdown of 3 meters, 10 meters, 20 meters. 
fire rate:	Shotguns typically have a slower fire rate, needing to pump a slide and change aim more often due to their
			close engagement range. But shotguns typically rely on other characteristics to maintain their distinction.
damage:		Shotgun damage at close range should be debilitatingly devestating. In order to have the stopping power 
			necessary to make the high-risk high-reward close play worth it, a hit with a shotgun shell under 10m should
			gank a non-elite enemy of the same level. As part of maintaining the personality of shotguns as a weapon class,
			a hit on an enemy between 10m and 20m should do non-negligable damage, but should deal less than a third of
			a non-elite enemy's health pool.
accuracy:	Shotguns suggest a similar high-risk, high-reward strategy to that of melee weapons. Since the risk of firing
			a shotgun comes in closing distance to your target, adding the additional risk of missing would be redundant.
			TL;DR: Shotguns should be quite accurate.
cost:		In general, shotguns themselves should be moderate to expensive, while buckshot ammo should be very cheap.
			Special ammo for shotguns changes their behavior more radically than special ammo for other weapons. This
			change in behavior modifies their apparent personality, so special shotgun shells should be very expensive
			in comparison to other ammo. i.e. dragonbreath shells should be about as expensive as plasma rounds for
			a long rifle.

G&W:
German arms manufacturer. Fairly standard in previous generation armies.

Mathews:
Old style guns. Reliable and not too costly. Also has a branch that builds custom builds that are very finely crafted.

Frontier:
ECSC R&D firm that deals in experimental weaponry for military applications and private sector security. Plasma, Lasers, Coilguns are mostly made by Frontier for humans.

Strudwick Arms:
European military armament group. Produce heavier weapons in a utilitarian package. Hedquartered in sector 5.

Level 10 and higher manufacturers:
Muzashi:
Japanese fine crafter of custom weapons. These guns are usually one-offs produced per customer order and require measurements. Hand-me downs are still expensive and may not be one-size-fits-all, but will outperform almost any military rifle.
Mostly produce energy weapons and long rifles.

Zurlinsk:
A relatively small design and prototyping firm. Their claim to fame is the ZAS MkII security Drone project, predecessor to the current SDA-C drones used in the military and private sector.
Mainly produce balistic weapons, including coilguns.

Demarani:
Italian custom weapon shop.
Very fine balistic weapons, especially shotguns and carbines.
