They have whiskers, and very sharp teeth. Their eyesite is very good, and they have low-light vision. Their build is generally more slender and graceful, but there have been bulkier Tundarin observed.
Society: Tribal with leading council of elders
The planet as a whole is unified under the banner of space exploration. there are many nationstates coming from historical tribes. Each nationstate is led by a council of elders, and a head elder is elected from each council to sit in on the grand council which overlooks issues on a planet-wide scale. They are hunters by nature, with a close tie to nature. Their cities typically blend in with the environement, whether it be large tree cities or hanging cliff cities.
They typically believe in spritualism, and their level of science has been brought about by their religios leaders. Science is seen as a result of their religion, rather than an explanation of it. This being the case, science is well taught and understood by most all Tundarin, and higher tier and newer prototype devices are revered as religios artifacts.
As far as the war goes, the Tundarin have been more peaceful towards humans, and have recently opened trade routes with the humans. While uncommon, Tundarin have been known to mingle with humans on occasion. Those who do have an understanding of Human Basic.
