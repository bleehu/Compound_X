Ranged Weapons List
Outside effective range, subtract 10 damage and 30%, max double the effective range.
Effects:
Plasma burn:  2d10 damage per turn (Stackable)
Armor Piercing: rounds ignore 15 DR to armored targets (add 15 damage against armored targets); subtract 15 damage to unarmored targets.
Hollow Point: add 15 damage to unarmored targets; subtract 15 damage to armored targets.
Supporting Fire: On Hit, target is forced to take cover for one action (stackable), unless they pass a 70% FORT or INT check. If they pass the check, they negate the cover, but take an additional shot (roll for hit).
Penetrating Damage: Armored targets take an additional 5 damage, and will need special treatments to remove armor fragments from their bodies. Unarmored targets take an additional 5 damage due to special ballistics characteristics. Target gains Bleeding condition.
Incendiary Round: target takes 2 * d10 explosive damage.
Capacitive Sheilded rounds deal CS burn. +5 dam against robotic units.
Bleeding: The target has sustained a heavy hit that must be patched up. Target takes d10/2 damage per turn until they pass a medical skill roll at DC of the damage sustained.
