=============================================

Each spell has a tree. Uppon leveling up, you gain a number of spell points equal to half your intelligence. You may choose to level up a spell for 1 spell point, or save up your spell points for later levels. You can progress the spell down it''s tree once you have spent the required number of points on the previous level. For example, if the progression cost is 3, you must spend 3 points on a spell before unlocking the ability to progress the spell.
You may only spend one point on a spell per level, unless specifically stated otherwise. In each spell description, the effect is increased based on the number of spell points put into progrssing the spell tree, these are referred to as Progression Levels or P.Lvls. You may progress any spell no more than 5 levels (including the progression from the previous spell). Even after progressing down the tree, you may choose to upgrade and use prior versions of a spell. Some spells age better than others.

Spells are written in the following format:
