Due to the faster firing rate, on a successful hit, the shooter rolls for an additional hit. Standard SMG rules apply, and additional shots fired due to this rule do not factor towards the SMG's dexterity based bonuses.

============================================================
Shotguns:
All pump shotguns take 1 action to fire, 1 action to rack. In the racking action, you can load an additional round of your specification for free. Double barrel and semi auto shotguns do not follow this rule.
For buck shot:
Roll d10 for # shots that make contact. Each shot does listed damage.
Outside of range, roll d10 for # shots, with the normal minimum number being the maximum number. E.G. for the hunting shotgun, if you shoot a target at 50m, roll a d10. If you roll a 6, you only hit with 5 pellets.
Outside of range for slugs, subtract 20 damage, and 20%.
Dragon�s Breath does not hit outside of range.

L.I.S.C. (Laser Ionizing Shock Cannon) 12EP
A powerful blue laser is used to ionioze the air between the user and their target. A complex array of mirrors additionaly ionizes the
air around the target. The Cannon then lets loose 40,000 volts of electricity, which travels down the path of the laser, delivering
painful theropy to the target, and anyone unfortunate enough to be nearby.
