Welcome to Compound X!

This document was created in order to help clear up how everything works in 
this game.
==============================
Premise:
==============================
Welcome to Compound X! The specific time and place that your adventure takes
place is up to your Game Master (often called a GM for short), but all of them
take place far in the future where humans have left earth on their faster-than-light
spaceships to explore dangerous new worlds fraught with friend and foe of all
manner of robots and aliens! 
Will you be the dashing hero? Or perhaps the evil villain plotting galactic 
domination? Or maybe a mercenary who's somewhere in between? The choice is
yours and your legend will be told as you play the game!
 
==============================
The Primary Game Mechanic:
==============================

You may now be thinking to yourself; "Self-person, we sure can't wait to go
gallivanting through the galaxy doing fantastic things and seeing the beautiful
galaxies! But how would we do that?" Well, yourself doesn't have the answer yet,
but good news! You just found it!

In Compound X, most things you will do will be accompanied by a 'roll'. That 
translates to rolling the dice. Rolling the dice is our way of factoring in
the human (or not human) tendency to do things in a way which isn't perfect.
When you roll high, you do very well. When you roll low, you goof up. But hold 
your horses, or kangaroo or what have you. This is a strategy RPG, not a gambling game.
Each roll will have numbers which you will add to or subtract from the one you 
get from the dice. This represents how good or bad your particular character is
at doing whatever it is you are attempting to do. What to add when is discussed
in detail below. 

For now, know that Compound X uses two ten-sided dice (usually called D10s) to
represent a percent. One of the D10s represents the number in the 10's place.
the other represents the number in the 1's place. Most dice sets come with two
D10s, one with a zero after the number on the face, the other without that zero.
In that case, obviously you add the numbers on the face of the dice together to
find out what you rolled. If your dice came from different sets, you must pick
which dice represents the tens place before you roll. i.e. if one die rolls a
40 and the other rolls a 6, you rolled 46%. Alternatively, if you have an orange
die which represents your ten's place and a purple die which represents your one's
place, and you roll an orange 3 and a purple 9 then you rolled 39%.

It's important to note that you don't have to roll for everything. Your character
probably knows how to do mundane things like brush their teeth, open an unlocked
door, and tie their shoes. It's okay to just do these things, even in combat.

==============================
Role Playing and Combat:
==============================

Compound X has two main 'modes' if you will: Combat, and Not in Combat. While in
combat, the rules are a little more specific so as to support strategy and planning.
During combat, each player takes their turn in a particular order, and while you can
still make up what you want to do, most actions fall into pre-existing categories 
that take a specific amount of time and typically do a specified amount of damage. 
More detail on that in the combat section of basic rules.

Out of combat, turns are a little more fluid. Usually players take their turn 
describing what they want to do when each player gets an idea of what to do.
If two players have an idea at the same time, please be courteous and take turns. It's
much easier for the GM to listen to one player at a time. In addition to taking 
turns, please also be polite and share the spotlight. You ALL are the main heroes 
or villains of this story. Make sure everyone gets a chance to do the one-liner they
want, or to have their moment of glory.

Either in combat or out, play usually follows this loop:

1.	The GM describes the environment and the situation. Usually the DM will ask
		"What do you want to do?"
2.	The player describes what they want to do
3. 	The GM checks if that's even a possible thing that can be done. (skip this
		step if that's obvious)
4.	The GM says what kind of roll is needed to see if the player succeeds, if 
		any roll is necessary.
5.	The player rolls the dice and adds the numbers as described below.
6. 	The GM checks their total against the Difficulty Challenge, a number that
		typically only the GM knows which represents how hard a typical task
		is. Then the GM narrates how the action goes depending on if the 
		player succeeds or fails and by how much.
7.	Then the next player begins their turn.

==============================
Your Character:
==============================
In Compound X, you control one particular person. This person is your avatar
in the game world. You decide what they say, how they react and what they do
just by telling your Game Master at the appropriate time. But before you can
jump right in and start playing, you need to create a character! This is often
one of the most fun parts of the game!
Making a character is a slightly involved process that can take a new player 
up to two hours to fully flesh out. There are several parts of characters which
are detailed below, but let's list them here briefly before we get into the 
nitty-gritty of it.

Base Stats - These decide what raw characteristics make up your character, and 
	are factored into most other decisions you make both in game and for the 
	rest of character creation. Choosing your stats is a very good way to start
	making a character.
Species/Race - Is your character a robot? What about a human? Or maybe the 
	catlike aliens known as Tundari? Different species and races get small
	bonuses to different aspects of combat and are liked or disliked by 
	different people in the galaxy accordingly.
Class 		- Think of this like your job. Are you a sniper, waiting for the
	perfect shot? Or are you a pilot who can thread a needle with your 
	starfighter? Or maybe you're a veteran soldier, who's seen it all. 
	Classes define what armor and weapons your character can use in combat,
	as well as certain special abilities which might help solve puzzles or
	get you better discounts at stores. Your class also dictates how much 
	money you start with to buy equipment.
Skills		- Each character learns things while going through life. Maybe
	your time in the military taught you how to navigate using the stars
	or maybe your time working at a mechanic's shop made you good at 
	repairing things? Or maybe you're one of those people who is just
	naturally good at hacking computers. Picking these numbers will
	represent that in the game world. 
Equipment	- Your equipment is made up of your character's weapon, armor
	and miscellaneous items. You'll get money to buy them with at the start
	of the game and you'll earn more money as you go about your adventures.
Feats		- Your character will gain special perks as you level up. This
	could range from reloading really fast, to having more health to being
	able to do a fast combat roll under fire. Tackle these when your 
	character advances to level 3.



==============================
Player Stats:
==============================

Each player has what are called Base Stats. An average person has a '5'
for each stat, but an average player has a '6' . These stats are:
Strength
Perception
Fortitude
Charisma
Intelligence
Dexterity
and Luck.

Usually you can tell a lot about a character just by their base stats. For
instance, a character with 9 strength and 3 intelligence is usually either
a brutish bully or a tough but lovable teddy bear of a person. Where a 
character with 10 intelligence and 2 charisma is probably a brilliant 
nerd who might be shy or just have a terrible stutter.

But your raw base stat is rarely used in calculations during the game. To
get the math to work out better, we usually us what is called a 'Stat Bonus'.
Stat bonuses are used very often. They are calculated as so:

Stat Bonus = (4 * Stat) - 20 
	which is equal to 
Stat Bonus = (Stat - 5) * 4
	if that's any easier.

For instance, if you were trying to lift something heavy, your GM may tell you
to roll a 'Strength Check' and add your 'Strength Bonus'. To do this, you would
roll two 10-sided dice as explained in the Primary Game Mechanic above, and add
your Strength Bonus to that. Let's say that you rolled a 71, and your Strength
Base Stat is a very beefy 8. Then your Strength bonus would be:
(8 - 5) * 4 = 3 * 4 = 12
and the score of your roll would be 
71 + 12 = 83
That's a really high roll! But that may or may not be enough to lift the object
depending on how heavy it is!

Each Base Stat has different specific effects. They are detailed below.

Strength:
	How strong are you? This stat dictates how big of a gun you can carry and
	how hard you can punch or hit with strength melee weapons. It might also allow 
	you to solve puzzles with the brute force approach.
		If you have 1 Strength, you are exceptionally weak and your max movement per
	2 actions is 2m (unless your Dex is 1) and you cannot wear armor that offers more 
	than 50% coverage.
Perception: 
	Your ability to see, hear, smell and sense the world around you, as well as
	to interpret what those sensations indicate. Perception affects your weapon 
	accuracy and ability to cut through the chaos of battle to stay oriented. A high
	perception makes you harder to sneak up on. 
		If you have 1 Perception, you are partially blind, only have 1 eye, or
	something similar. You cannot use the Search or Awareness skills and you have a 
	-20 malus to Speech skill rolls. 
Fortitude: 
	How tough are you? Fortitude dictates your maximum health, how hard you are to 
	knock off of your feet, and contributes to your saving throws.
		If you have 1 Fortitude, you are exceptionally frail. You can't inflict lethal 
	unarmed damage and your unarmed damage is halved. Also, when you deal melee damage, 
	you inflict half of the damage on yourself.
Charisma: 
	How good are you at communicating with those around you? Charisma affects a 
	number of interpersonal skills like haggling and diplomacy. It also contributes to 
	how hard it is to dominate your will.
		If you have 1 Charisma, you have a debilitating speech impediment. You have
	an additional malus of -24 when using Speech, Deceive, and etc. skill. Under normal 
	circumstances, you have to succed a DC 30 CHA skill check in order to communicate 
	with a non-player character (NPC). In combat, vocal communication to anything costs
	1 Action.
Intelligence: 
	How smart are you? Intelligence dictates how many Nanites you have to cast spells
	with or use certain Feats and abilities. It also affects how quickly you acquire new
	skills when you	level up and how proficient you are at using some of those skills.
		If you have 1 intelligence, let's just say, you aren't particularly smart. 
	You cannot attempt to use any skill that you do not have Proficiency in (see the 
	"RP / Using Skills" section).
Dexterity: 
	How nimble are you? Dexterity decides your maximum move speed in combat, as well 
	as how much damage you do with finesse melee weapons like knives. Dexterity also 
	contributes to skill checks for doing things with a character's body like climbing,
	jumping, or dancing.
		If you have 1 Dexterity, you are especially clumsy or suffer from a debilitating
	illness which affects your ability to move swiftly and precisely. You cannot learn any
	skills that use Dexterity as the contributing stat (for example, lockpicking).
Luck: 
	Some people are just lucky! A GM will often have you roll luck to see if a door was
	left unlocked or if you just happened to duck to pick up a coin off the ground right 
	when an assassin is trying to shoot you in the head. Luck also has a significant effect
	on what loot you find in dungeons and your chance to roll a critical hit.
		If you have 1 Luck, it goes without saying, you are very unlucky. At the start of
	a combat encounter, roll a d10 and receive a penalty from the Black Cat table, below.

Assigning Stats to a new character
	When making a new character, you'll have to assign their Base stats.
This will tell you a lot about your character. When assigning your stats,
no stat can be higher than a 9 before applying racial/species bonuses and
no stat can be lower than a 1 after applying racial/species bonuses. 
Additionally, even after race/species bonuses, feats, equipment and base stat 
bonuses from leveling, no stat can ever be over 15 until your character is 
level 15. After level 15, the limit for stat points is 20. The number of 
initial base stat points that you have to apply is listed with your Race or 
Species. See chapter 1: Races if you haven't yet. 

Leveling up:
Gain feats according to the table below.
With Charisma 9 or higher, receive more feats. The feats listed in the table are totals, 
not to be added together.
every level, gain 2*int skill points
every 5th level, +1 Class feat
On levels 5, 9, 15 and 20, gain a stat point. The stat increase happens before any 
calculations, so if you had 10 int, and increased to 11, you would get 22 skill points
for the level. Additionally, any stat point alteration forces a recalculation on all
affected values.

==============================
Saving Throws
==============================

Saving throws are used in dire or critical situations to defend against very 
negative effects.
    - Will: defend against a mind affect (Ex: throw off hopelessness after 
    	crashing in an escape pod)
    - Shock: maintain composure after serious damage (Ex: stay conscious after 
    	being shot by a high caliber round)
    - Reflex: quickly react to an event (Ex: dodge falling debris, fire at an 
    	enemy if they leap from one piece of cover to another).
the equations are as follows:
    - Will: 2*(Cha + Fort - 6) Rational: Normally wisdom would be applied, so 
    	Will in compound X is descried as your internal voice motivating you to
        endure a mental hardship.
    - Shock: 2*(Fort + Int - 6) Rational: You need to recognize that you are 
    	in shock, and resist its physical effects.
    - Reflex: 2*(Per + Dex - 6) Rational: In order to react quickly to an event
    	you need to be able to see it coming.

==============================
Medicine Saving Throws
==============================

Ouch! you've just been shot! You'd better call for a medic or apply a medikit 
before you bleed out! "But how do I use a medikit? Or if I'm a medic, how do I 
stabilize and heal an ally?" I''m glad you asked. The rules are as follows:
The medicine DC is equal to the damage dealt. On a fail skill check, no 
healing occurs. On a success, heal an amount equal to Medic skill + DC surplus.
Ex: player is dealt 70 damage. Medic has 25 skill. Medic rolls an 86 (with 
medic skill), so they heal 25+(86-70) for 41 health healed.
Individual wounds are healed individually. 3 20 damage wounds needs three 
rolls of 21 or higher.
Ex: Player takes 70 damage. Medic has 25 skill. Medic rolls an 86 (with medic 
skill), so they heal 25+(86-70) for 41 health. Now the player still has a 29 
damage deficit (70-41), so the medic would need to roll over a DC of 29 to 
heal the remaining 29 damage. (Cannot overheal a wound).
Medics need not use a medic-kit so long as the have their medicine bag (or 
equivalent) on their person. If they do not have their medicine bag with them 
when they are trying to heal a teammate, they can make the attempt at a +20 DC.
Using a medikit:
Medic-kit, non-medic user: works as if you are a medic with skill 30.
Medic-kit, medic user: Works as normal, but add 30 to amount healed.


==============================
Death, Dying and Downed
==============================
Oh no! You have less than 1 health point left! What now!?!

The good news is you are not* dead yet. You are bleeding out. 
When your character falls below 1 hit point, you get 3 saving throws called Death 
Saving Throws. These throws are not tied to any attribute. When you fail any three 
times, you die. If you succeed, you do not lose one of these three Death 
Saving Throws, but will still have to roll next round if you are not stabalized. 
Once you have expended a saving throw, the next time you fall 
below 1 health point your saving throws fall to 2. the next time, you have 1. you 
can only replenish these saving throws by going a whole encounter without having 
to use any. Each encounter that you go without expending a saving throw 
replenishes one saving throw up to a maximum of three.

Downed
The state of having less than one Health Point is called being "downed." It is also
sometimes called "bleeding out." They are equivalent. While a character is downed,
they cannot move, cannot stand under their own power and fall prone if not 
supported by other means. They cannot speak, but can mumble incomprehensively.
Every turn that a character takes while they are downed, they must make a Death
Saving Throw of DC 50. Success and failure of these throws is detailed above.

Stabalize
As an action, a teammate may bring you back up to 1 health point by suceeding 
on a Medicine skill check to stabalize you. Once stabalized, you may take actions 
and speak as normal. Don't forget that a recently stabalized character may need 
to take an action to retrieve a dropped weapon and/or take an action to stand 
back up if you have fallen.
The skill DC to stabalize a fallen comrade is 80. Medicine skill, INT mod, and any
bonuses from medical equipment such as medpacks may be added to that roll. 


*Footnote: Some hazards can reduce you to zero health points and kill you 
instantly. Some examples are falling several stories, lava baptisms,
or having a space station dropped on you. Do not do these things. They are
also known to the state of California to cause cancer. 


==============================
RP / Using Skills:
==============================
The GM may ask you to roll a certain skill to see if your character can do 
something. This may be something like, "Roll Awareness to see if you spot the 
truck barreling towards you," or it might look like, "Roll Medicine to see if 
you can patch up the gaping wound in your chest spewing blood." Anytime you 
need to Pass a Skill check, there will be a DC (Difficulty Check) you have to 
exceed in order to successfully pass the check. Again: YOU MUST ROLL *OVER* A DC 
TO SUCCEED IN A SKILL CHECK. the DC does not need to be given out by the GM, but if
a DC seems too high, you have the right to grumble (but seriously, ask your GM if 
something seems too difficult. There is usually a reason why tying your shoe 
takes a DC of 70% on that particular day, etc). After you have rolled, please
apply any and all relevant skills to your result. If you are rolling to silently
take down an opponent, the GM can either have you roll a stealth check and an 
unarmed combat check, or double the DC, and have you roll once adding both 
modifiers. Also add any relevant Stat Bonuses to a roll. When rolling 
awareness, add your PER Bonus, etc.
At any time out of combat, you may decide to use one of your skills. If you 
are not pressured by imminent / immediate danger, you may "take a 100%" to pass 
a skill check, then apply any ranks in the skill. When rushed by a time 
constraint or danger, you can "take a 50%" to pass a skill check, then apply any 
ranks in said skill. However, some checks cannot be passed in this way. If you 
are staring at a ship''s blast doors, and want to kick them down, you can't take
additional time to increase your odds of success.
If you want to use a skill in combat, see the "Combat: Actions" subsection.
Skill ranks are exact percentiles to pass a skill check. If you have 50 ranks 
in a skill, then you have a +50% chance to pass a skill check for that skill. 
Every time you purchase a new skill for 10 Skill points, it starts as a +10% 
skill. When leveling up you may add up to 10 points to any one skill.
Normally a character can attempt any skill check whether or not they have invested 
in learning the skill; however, sometimes a character will have more penalties if
they attempt to use a skill that they don't have "Proficiency" in. A character has 
Proficiency in a skill when they have 10 or more skill points in that skill.

Defenders win ties for opposing rolls. If a character ties a DC they fail.

==============================
Player Weapon Customization:
==============================

Weapon customization can be done anytime you are in a town, space station, or 
other mercantile area. Ask the GM if there are weapon shops or kiosks around, 
they should point you to one. From there you can apply upgrades and 
attachments.
The GM may tell you specific attachments that are available, or they may say 
you can just go about your usual customization. Only one attachment can be 
used per section (unless specifically stated in the item''s description). 

==============================
Combat:
==============================

Combat starts when either you or an enemy decides they would like to make an 
attack. Each "Player turn" lasts 4-6 seconds, and consists of 4 "Actions" 
(described below).

//Rules for stealth attack / flat foot
//-20%, -10% crit, reduce chance to hit armour (20%?)
//If your attack would normally force the target to roll a fort save, they are 
//incapacitated by default with no roll.

Melee Notes:
A character occupies 1m of space. however, as Compound X is not played out on a 
squares-board, usually it doesn''t matter if two players are within the same 
1m space.
Two Players locked in melee combat are considered to be in adjacent 1m spaces, 
not in the same 1m space. Have you ever seen a fight? you don't start 
face-to-face unless you're at a bar.
Generally speaking, once a character has initiated melee combat with another 
character, they are both considered to be in "melee combat," and occupy 
adjacent 1m spaces. At this point (unless one character has a CQB weapon) 
both characters are assumed to be using their fists or other melee weapons. If
a character wishes to leave melee combat, they incur a "penalty attack." 
Characters also incur "penalty attacks" when moving through or next to an 
enemy character''s 1m space, or within range of a melee weapon that the enemy 
has equipped, and when performing a skill check when in melee combat.
Melee combat is relatively simple. To hit an enemy player, add your dexterity 
or strength modifier to a roll, plus any relevant skill. The result must be 
greater than the opponent''s DEX * 5 + any skill in combat (Guard DC). Your 
damage dealt is based on your DEX or STR modifier. If you are wielding a 
weapon against an unarmed opponent, they may still incur damage depending on 
their skill.
A character may grapple another character when they are both in melee 
distance. Doing so provides the grappled player a "penalty attack" on the 
grappling player. During grappling, both sides roll opposing grapple checks to 
see who maintains control. Once you have control you may make a grapple check 
to subdue your opponent (either through choke-out, pin, or a joint lock). You 
may also strike an opponent during grappling, but if the strike fails your 
opponent may attempt to gain control of the grapple. Skill in grappling is 
different than skill in unarmed combat.

Actions:
During combat, your character is given 4 Actions to use for fighting, 
movement, using items, etc. Here is a table of common tasks and their
relative cost:

Reloading a Pump-Action Shotgun - 4 Actions
Reloading a Bolt-Action weapon - 3 Actions
Moving DEX meters - 2 Actions
Hunkering Down - 2 Actions
Firing a semi-auto gun - 1 Action
Cast a Spell - 1 Action
Aiming Down Sights - 1 Action
turning on a flashlight - 1 Action
Unholstering Pistol - 1 Action
Performing a skill check (other than Awareness) - 1 Action
Conversing with partners - Free Action
Getting your bearings / non skill-based perception - Free Action

Movement:
You can run DEX number of meters per 2 actions. A character with 1 DEX can 
move 1m per 2 actions, or 2m per 4 actions (a full turn). You can sprint 
instead of running, for a +2 movement bonus per two actions. However,
firing your weapon after doing so will cause you to incur a +30% firing penalty.
The penalty occurs during the actions you sprint, as well as 2 actions 
afterwards. You can stack sprinting a number of Actions equal to your Fortitude; 
however, for each Action taken sprinting, an Action of recovery (and resulting 
+30% weapon penalty) must be taken after the sprinting ends.
You can jump horizontally Dex/2 meters, and add 1 meter if you have a 5 meter 
running start.
You can jump vertically Str/3 meters.

Fighting:
During combat, most weapons are Semi-Auto, meaning that each time you pull the 
trigger, the gun fires and chambers a new round automatically one time. It 
takes 1 Action to fire a semi-auto weapon in this way. Some guns, 
such as Shotguns and Bolt-Action sniper rifles require 2 Actions to fire 
the gun, where the first Action is a trigger pull, and the second Action
is the re-chambering of the weapon.
To hit, Players must roll a percentile that is over their weapon's % miss 
stat. When an enemy is in cover, their cover score is added to your weapon's 
miss chance. If your normal miss chance is 25, and the enemy is in full cover, 
your miss chance is increased by 50, for a final DC of 75.
Critical Hits:
If your Luck is 5, on a roll of 90-1 through 90-5, the hit is considered a 
Critical hit, and deals an extra 10 damage. on a roll of 90-6 through 00-0, 
the hit is considered an Extra-Critical hit, and deals an extra 20 damage. 

Your Luck modifier ((Luck-5)*4) is subtracted from the lower bound of your critical
hit range and half of your luck modifier is subtracted from the lower bound of your
extra-critical hit range. All weapons can critical hit except for Fully-Automatic
weapons (weapons that shoot more than 1 bullet per half-action by default).

Gun Jams:
On a roll of 00-01, the weapon Jams, necessitating a weapon skill check, DC 60.
When a player is defending against a hit, they roll Percentiles under their 
armor in order to apply a Damage Reduction, or to apply damage to their 
Capacitive Shields if the player has them.

Hip Firing doubles a weapon''s miss chance. It is much smarter to takes one 
action to Aim, and spend the rest of your shots on firing. Its also a great 
idea to take an action at the end of your turn to "hunker," and gain a 25% 
cover advantage.

Using Cover:
Chances are, if an enemy can see you in Compound X, they can hit you. Using 
cover will make it harder to be hit. You will encounter many types of cover 
while adventuring throughout the galaxy. Many small objects provide only 
partial cover, either by partially obscuring your silhouette, or by providing 
slight protection from projectiles. Full cover will do both to a better 
degree. Debuffs to enemies %Miss are as follows:
No Cover: +0%
Partial Cover: +25%
Full Cover: +50%
Hunkering: +25% on top of whatever cover you''re behind.

Hunkering costs one action, and you cannot fire your weapons. Imagine 
curling up in a ball, to pose the absolute smallest target possible. Its a 
free action to un-hunker

Reloading:
When a gun runs out of ammunition, the user must pause to reload. "But how long 
do I gotta be outta the battle?" Great question!
Each gun has a "Reload DC," rated based on the skill and brevity of the 
weapon''s reload. For example, an assault rifle, which has a very obvious 
magazine release button and protruding magazine, has an average DC of 25. More 
complex weapons, such as high-precision sniper systems or exotic sub-machine 
guns might have a higher DC, maybe 35. If the Player passes the reload, then 
the reload time is standard. For Box-Magazine fed Semi- and Fully-Automatic 
weapons, this is 2 Actions. Other, more complex weapons will specify their 
reload time. On a critical Success (anything in the 90-100 range), the reload 
time is halved (for Bolt-Actions it is reduced to 1 Action). On a failure,
the reload time takes double.

When players take more than 70 damage, they must roll a Shock save at a DC of 
the damage taken. On fail they pass out. on success they stay conscious. When 
players fail, they may roll each turn at a DC of 70 to wake up. They continue 
to roll either for (15 - FORT) turns, or until they pass.

Conditions:
Bleeding - d10/2+1 (drop the remainder) stackable damage per turn. Broken with 
Medicine Skill check. DC varies. If you have a bleed condition, seek medical aid
    immediately, You CAN Bleed Out, you have been warned.
Burning - 2d10 damage per turn. Broken with a Maneuver Skill Check. DC 40. 
    Every 2 turns, the degree of the burn intensifies
Downed - Your health has fallen below 0. See Death and Dying above.
Frozen - d10 damage per turn. lasts until a source of heat is applied to the 
    wound, or with Medicine Skill check, DC 50
Fear - No actions, except running away form the source of fear, or rolling to 
    defeat fear. DC 50, Will save.
Fear, Greater - No actions, except rolling to defeat fear. DC 75, Will save.
CS Burn - 1d10/2 stackable damage for 2 turns. + 5 damage against robots, on hit.
Necrosis - 2d10 +5 damage per turn. Seek medical attention immediately. If 
    left unhealed for more than a day, the infection spreads 1 foot per day. 
    Medicine DC 75, must be rolled.
Pinned Down - Target pinned (hunkered, no movement) for 2 full turns or until they 
    pass a Will saving throw at DC of 70, whichever is quicker.
Plasma Burn - 1d10+1 stackable damage per turn, for 2 turns if the target's armor
    is pierced/missed. If the targets armor is hit/pierced, the armor's AP level is 
    reduced by 1, permanently (repairable, DC 60% Repair check), not stackable. 
Poisoned - d10 damage per turn. After 5 turns, some poisons may induce 
    unconsciousness. DC 50, Fortitude. Greater / Lesser poison increases damage 
    (+5/-5) and DC (+25,-10).
Buzzed (drunk) - Many drinks in the galaxy contain a substance called alchohol.
	When consuming these drinks, the effect should list a FORT save to avoid
	increasing your level of intoxication. The first level of intoxication is Buzzed.
	While buzzed, you gain a +10% to miss with any attack and a temporary -1
	to Perception. At the same time, you get a +1 to charisma and luck. You also
	take a -20 to skill checks involving driving, flying or opperating heavy 
	machinery. If you fail a Fort save to prevent increasing your intoxication
	level while buzzed, you become hammered. As long as you don't become 
	hammered, being buzzed will wear off in two hours.
Hammered (drunk) - While hammered, you take a -30 to accuracy rolls when
	attacking and a -50 to skill checks involving driving, flying or opperating
	heavy machinery. You take a temporary -2 to dex, perception and charisma.
	If your level of intoxication increases while you are hammered, you black
	out and you are now Downed.
	As long as you don't black out, being hammered will turn into being 
	buzzed after two hours.
Stunned/Paralyzed - Affected target cannot take actions for the duration.

==============================
Damage Types and Armour types
==============================

There are 4 main types of damage in compound X: Ballistic (conventional 
firearms, bows), Laser, Plasma, and melee. Additionally, some Ballistic, Laser 
and melee weapons can deal non-lethal variants. These damage types interact 
differently with the two types of armour. Ballistic weapons and ballistic armour 
are the first damage type and armour type players will come across. When 
ballistic armour is shot by a ballistic weapon, the armour may apply some damage 
reduction, then the player takes damage. The second type of damage players may 
come across is plasma. Plasma damage stacks, and interacts fairly neutrally 
with both ballistic and CS armours. Ballistic armour applies some DR to any 
plasma damage, but in turn the plasma will melt away part of the armour. One 
Tenth of the plasma's damage is removed from the armour's hit percent. For CS 
shields, Plasma deals full damage to the shielding, plus inflicts plasma burn 
on the wearer. Laser damage is the third type pf damage encountered by players. 
All lasers deal burn damage on hit. Lasers are completely nullified by CS 
shields, dealing all of their damage to the shielding, and inflicting no burn 
damage. Lasers deal full damage to armoured targets, and remove nothing off of 
the armour's hit percent. If a player wearing ballistic armour is hit with a 
laser, they receive damage as if they weren't wearing any armour.

Beyond weapon damage there are also environmental threats to consider. An 
important note is on fall damage. A player can fall up to their Dex/2 in 
meters before needing to roll an acrobatics check. If the surface they are 
landing on is somehow fouled, the GM may require the player to roll an 
acrobatics check when landing from any height at their discretion. On a failed 
roll, take damage equal to 2 times the height fallen. The player also incurs 
one injury, depending on the severity of the fall. Some examples are below:
    Sprained ankle(s)
    Broken ankle(s)
    Broken leg(s)
    Broken arm(s) in addition to leg(s)
    Broken everything

==============================
Casting Spells
==============================

There are a few classes which are able to cast spells, Paladins, Mages and 
Sorcerers. Casting spells is very similar to performing other actions. 
Normally, a spell takes one action to cast. The performer of the spell will 
have to pass a Skill DC in order to successfully cast the spell. This DC is 
the number of Nanites used to cast the spell, plus an bonuses the target gains 
from cover. For Mages and Sorcerers this is a Spellcast DC, and for Paladins 
this is a Knowledge [Nanites] DC. Mages/Sorcerers can add any skill points 
they have in Sorcery to their rolls, and Paladins may do the same with their 
Knowledge [Nanites] skill. Some spells may also require the target to make a 
saving throw in order to avoid the spell or negate its effects. Generally 
speaking, spells have a range that is dependant on either the Charisma score 
of the caster or the Charisma Modifier.

==============================
Cloaking
==============================

Cloaking is available in the armour section, but also available to some 
classes as a class feature. For non-class cloakers, the rules are as follows:
Expend 50 Nanites to activate the cloaking shield. while moving, the cloak DC 
is 30. while staying still, the cloak DC is 60. There is a tell-tale shimmer 
in the cloak, as the micro-foil has a hard time keeping up with moving 
environments. Once the wearer has settled down, the micro-foil is able to 
reproduce the surrounding environment better and will stabilize. However, once 
you have performed a combat action, the cloak fizzes out, as you have shifted 
your concentration from maintaining the cloak to something else. When using a 
skill (accessing a terminal, fixing something, etc.) your DC is 30, as you are 
diverting your attention. See the following table for durations:
